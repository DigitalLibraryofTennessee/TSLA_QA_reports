445. The U.S.S. Housatonic was a mine layer in World War I. This ship layed 9339 mines and survived the war. Guy E. Housholder of Knoxville enlisted at age 18 and served Fireman 2nd Class. He was honorably discharged as an Engineman 2nd Class on August 32, 1919. After the war, he worked as a machinist for the railroad, and died in 1961.
446. Pvt. Virgil Metcalf of Etowah, Tennessee, is seated in uniform in this photograph, apparently created in a studio in France during World War I. An unknown fellow soldier stands behind him. Metcalf trained at Camp Sheridan, Alabama. He served on Co. A, 47th Eng. Battn., and was overseas from July 13, 1918 until July 6, 1919.
447. Virgil Metcalf posed with two other soldiers for this photograph, which was likely taken in the United States during training, based on the newness of their uniforms and the leggings. The note on the back reads "myself, a boy named Joshua and Pardue." Metcalf trained at Camp Sheridan, Alabama. He served on Co. A, 47th Eng. Battn. He was overseas from July 13, 1918 until July 6, 1919.
448. This lithograph tells the story of Co. B, 117th Inf. Regt. during World War I. Features ovals of King George of England, President Woodrow Wilson and French President Raymond Poincar�. It lists commanding officers and soldiers of company. The company's history is chronicled at the bottom. It belonged to Sgt.

455. This photo postcard shows several unknown soldiers in front of a tent encampment. A few hold rifles and one soldier in front holds a banjo.
456. This postcard belonged to Sgt. Julius Samuel Burchfield, who served in Co. B, 117th Inf. Regt., 30th Div. On the back the names J. L. Chism, Supply Co. 119 and J. Owens, Supply Co. 118 are written.
457. Pvt. Roy Helton of Maryville posed in uniform for this studio photograph. He served in Co. C, 117th Inf. Regt., 30th Div. during World War I. He served overseas from May 11, 1918 until December 21, 1918 and fought at the Cambria Front. He was severely wounded October 31, 1918, and was reported as "10% disabled" in view of his occupation after the war.
458. This soldier posed in front of a tent, possibly during training.
459. Sgt. Julius S. Burchfield, Co. B, 117th Inf. Regt., 30th Div., traveled over to Europe on this Liberty Ship. From Rasar, Tennessee, he enlisted as a private in June 1917, was promoted to corporal in October 1917, then to sergeant in October 1918. He served overseas from May 11, 1918 until March 27, 1919.
460. This panaramic photograph of Camp Sevier, S. C. belonged to Pvt. Guy Bolinger of Blount County. During World War I, the 30th and the 81st divisions trained at the camp. Bolinger served in Co. B, 117th. Inf. Regt., 30th Div. and was overseas from May 11, 1918 until October 8, 1919. He was at Ypres, the Hindenburg Line, Luneva, Premont, and Estress, and was severely wounded on October 8, 1918. According to his family, he survived a gas attack.  After the war, he moved to North Carolina.
461. Newspaper photo of Lt. Milton L. Harper with article "Maryville's Grief for her Dead" listing Gold Star from the town and an article "Letters from France Tell Harper's Death" in which a Major Hathaway describes how Harper, his adjutant standing next to him, was killed by shell fire on Oct. 8 while he was untouched. The piece includes a copy of a letter Lt. Harper had sent his mother describing an attack on German lines and heavy action just a few days before his death.
462. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement. During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest montly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacement combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
463. The location is the company's base camp at the Hook, the last place Brock was stationed. At this washstand, men shaved and washed up; there were no showers here. The front is positioned a few miles directly behind Brock. To his right were two 240mm guns and across the road behind him was a battery of 155mm housing--Long Tom long-barrelled/long-range guns. In front of him were 8-inch guns that shot over the tents at base camp. There was never quiet until the cease fire. The guitar was everybody's guitar.
464. Image of the USS General W. A. Mann. Photo was purchased on the ferry boat that took Brock from Camp Stoneman (California) to the San Francisco port; the picture was bought, addressed, and mailed from the ferry boat. Hundreds of people were aboard; the military dependents (wives and children) never came up on deck with the soldiers. The bottom decks were filled with cars. Brock'stayed on deck and ate salty peanuts to counter seasickness.
465. This 622-foot troopship with a maximum wartime capacity of 6,800 troops served with the United States Navy in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Named for Major General William Abram Mann of the United States Army, the USS General W.A. Mann received her commission on October 13, 1943. She boasts two service stars for the Korean War and one for the Vietnam War. Notably, the USS General W.A. Mann conveyed valuable Republic of Korea government cargo and the private papers of South Korean President Syngman Rhee from Pusan to San Francisco in August of 1950. The Navy decommissioned this troop transport on December 11, 1965.
466. Brock'shown at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri when in basic training; it was probably infantry training at this stage. This is the barracks where they were being housed. Brock was inducted in Nashville. He was first sent to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, where the men were issued clothes and pulled KP (kitchen police or patrol) duty. Brock arrived at Fort Leonard Wood in January of 1952.
467. Ground was broken in south-central Missouri for a major Army training facility, the Seventh Corps Area Training Center, on December 3, 1940. The War Department named the installation Fort Leonard Wood. The service of Major General Leonard Wood spanned forty years and included functioning as a surgeon in the Apache Indian Wars of the 1880s, initially commanding the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War, serving as the Army's Chief of Staff, and holding the position of Governor General of the Philippine Islands. The fort that would bear Major General Wood's name first served as a World War II infantry division training area, but soon became an engineer training site, as well. Three hundred thousand soldiers received instruction at Fort Leonard Wood during the course of World War II. Though designated an inactive post following World War II, the Army reopened Fort Leonard Wood in 1950 to supply basic and engineer training to soldiers of the Korean War. The mission of training as the cadre unit for Fort Leonard Wood at this time was given to the reactivated 6th Armored Division. After the Korean War, Fort Leonard Wood became a permanent post designated as the United States Army Training Center Engineer. Fort Leonard Wood garnered the United States Army Engineer School in the 1980s when it was moved from Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In the 1990s, Fort Leonard Wood also came to house the United States Army Military Police School and the United States Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School. David Franklin Brock was drafted and entered the Army for training on January 21st of 1952. After staying a week at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and being issued clothing and uniforms, Brock arrived at Fort Leonard Wood and received approximately two months of infantry training followed by several months of engineer instruction. Brock boarded the troop transport USS General W.A. Mann at San Francisco in early July of 1952 to sail for Korea.
468. Brock, in his fatigues with his 2nd Division patch clearly visible, has been working on roads. His helmet is to his right. The squad has probably been blowing up rocks. They were clearing drainage ditches for road construction. Engineers used shape charges (cone-shaped) to blast what is under the road bed. Blasting cap goes on top, but the explosion happens underground, and the force blows down. This would have been his last road detail before coming home.
469. Over the course of its history, the Second Indianhead Infantry Division has fought in four wars, obtained over twenty campaign participation credits, and has yielded forty Medal of Honor recipients. The Division organized on October 26, 1917 at Bourmont, Haute Marne, France, and first saw combat in the Battle of Belleau Wood. The Second engaged in six Western Front campaigns during World War I, stood the most decorated American Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) at the end of the fighting, and sported what was termed the most coveted shoulder flash of the AEF. Based out of Fort Sam Houston at San Antonio at the time, the Indianhead Division was one of only three divisions remaining intact and on active duty throughout the interwar period. World War II found the Tomahawk Warriors going ashore at Normandy and fighting in six European campaigns. The Second Division proved the first unit sailing from the United States to reach Korea following the outbreak of hostilities in the summer of 1950. The Warrior Division was the first to break out of the Pusan Perimeter; led the Eighth Army drive to the Manchurian Border; at a terrible cost, protected the Eighth Army in its withdrawal upon Chinese intervention in November of 1950; and triumphed in the February 1951 Battle of Chipyong-ni, considered by many the turning point of the war. The unit helped defeat the enemy's spring offensive of 1951 and continued to fight outpost and hilltop battles until the conclusion of the conflict. In July of 1965, the Division returned to be stationed in South Korea as the Second Infantry Division/ROK-U.S. Combined Division with a mission of guard the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and help maintain peace in the region. The distinctive nickname and shoulder sleeve insignia of the Second Division grew out of a contest initiated by 2nd Supply Trains Commander Colonel William F. Herringshaw to produce a design to emblazon the Division's trucks. A combination of the winning designs (1st place an Indian Head and 2nd place a star) resulted in the accepted vehicle insignia. Toward the end of the year, the design was chosen for the Division's shoulder patch, incorporating specifically the sculpted Indian Head appearing on the American five dollar gold piece. A total of forty-four variations of the insignia sprang up to denote different components of the Division, until a June 1920 directive deemed the design for all Indianhead Division personnel to be a black shield with a white star and Indian Head.
470. A  .45 pistol is strapped at Brock's side, and there is snow alongside the road. He is not near the front because he is not wearing his helmet. Brock has his cap on with the big "E" and belt buckle that indicate combat engineers. His 2nd Infantry Division patch is on his shoulder; North Koreans were offering a reward for 2nd Division patches. All engineers' vehicles had "Eng." on the bumpers.
471. As a soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. The summer of 1952 found Dog Company on the line west of Chorwon repairing heavy monsoon damage to roads and bridges, mass producing prefabricated log bunkers for the 2nd Division through Operation Abe Lincoln, and designing a new mobile attack bunker for the infantry that could be quickly assembled for overhead cover and protection. The 2nd Engineers also laid minefields, tactical wire, napalm and booby traps, often under mortar and artillery fire, to strengthen the hill outposts of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Arrowhead Ridge. Attention was then turned to improving supply routes and shelter and installation construction for the winter. After coming out of reserve in late January of 1953, the 2nd Engineers supported infantry regiments in battle positions in the British Commonwealth section. Company D maintained the main supply routes to the front, in general support of the division, and continued to build bunkers for the 2nd Infantry Division. Another stint in reserve was followed by more support of the 2nd Division by the battalion beginning in July of 1953 in the Chorwon-Kumhwa sector. Here engineers often confronted enemy patrols and heavy mortar, artillery, and sniper fire. Toward the close of the war, Company D worked as engineers during the day and served as blocking infantry at night at the position known as the Hook. During the American Revolution, George Washington appointed the first engineer officers, and engineers have served in combat in all the wars to follow. The 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion identifies as its parent unit the Battalion of Engineers, initially organized on August 3, 1861. Prior to the Korean War, the 2nd Engineers and its lineage had been awarded campaign streamers from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II. In the Korean War, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion protected the retreating Eighth Army and 2nd Infantry Division at Kunu-ri when U.S. and U.N. troops were surprised and overrun by the Chinese in late fall of 1950. As a result of a missed communication, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was left as the last unit in opposition to the Chinese onslaught and was decimated on November 30, 1950.
472. A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home. Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised. Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952. The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room. Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman. The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed. The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping. Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy, washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well. Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen. With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70% of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II's percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans. These children garnered the label "dust of the street", having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger. American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.
473. Pictured is the 2nd Division Orphans' Home--referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home. It was built in June of 1952 at Chongpyong-ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating. Brock was only at the orphanage the one time during his tour of duty. The 2nd Division emblem, a jeep, and little orphans are visible in the image.
474. In a typical base camp, such as this, each squad would be in a tent with eight to ten cots. The big tent would have been the mess tent. There were four companies of engineers in a batallion. Brock believes the location to be the Chorwon Valley--his first station. The t-shirt Brock is wearing has "2nd Combat ENGRS" across the top, below a star, then an image of a dog for "D" company, and "KOREA" across the bottom.
475. This image of twenty-year old David Franklin Brock standing above his first military station in Korea clearly conveys his youth
and lack of worldliness. This photograph can be compared with others in this collection taken of Brock toward the end of his service overseas. Brock was granted one agricultural deferment allowing him to assist his father in harvesting crops on their Van Buren County farm, but he had to report for duty in January of 1952. Brock had left the state only once before, but now the conflict in Korea would whisk him a world away. The Korean War Memorial in Washington dedicated to the nation's sons and daughters called to fight in the war reads, in part, that Americans, like young Brock, were asked to defend a country they did not know and a people they had never met. Brock's family had weathered the Great Flood of 1929, the Great Depression, and World War II. His generation had been schooled in sacrifice and patriotism. Like many others his age, he had an older brother who had served in World War II. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement. During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest monthly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacement combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
476. Brock pictured relaxing on a bench in front of the Tokyo Civil Service Hotel. This was his one instance of leave during the war. Fellow squad member Connors, from Dallas, Texas, accompanied Brock on R&R. Their leave lasted one week. During that time, they only went into the city once, opting instead to stay in the hotel and rest. The hotel had a bar and restaurant, and would deliver food and wine to the room.
477. Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at Civil Service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.
478. In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. After extended periods of service near the front, units would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for approximately thirty days for rest, additional training and equipping, and possible secondary missions. Combat engineers in particular seemed charged with continuing their construction and maintenance assignments while in reserve. The 2nd Engineers spent most of January of 1953 in reserve; the battalion also moved its companies through reserve during April, May, and most of June of 1953. During both periods of reserve, the 2nd Engineers rehabilitated their vehicles and equipment and received training in engineer and infantry tactics.
479. Martinez, Brock, and an unknown soldier pictured in reserve. The fence in the image is to keep Korean civilians out.  Brock's unit went into reserve twice during his service--once in January of 1953 and once in the spring of 1953.
480. Brock pictured in front of the mess hall at his first base camp in the Chorwon Valley. Logs anchored in the ground serve to keep soil from washing away with the rains, and they can be used as seating for eating or watching movies outside. Brock's company got to this base camp just in time for monsoon season. A week or two after they arrived, the rains washed out the roads and a bridge for the air strip. Brock kept his cigarettes and wallet under his helmet as the only dry spot. Brock recounts that the soldiers were served good food in the mess hall; the commander of the 2nd Engineers and General James C. Fry made sure the supply outfit behaved.
481. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook.

482. Brock holding a radio in a field. Engineer work is being done nearby. Trailers, such as the one in the background, were used to haul engineer equipment behind a jeep. Each squad had a radio, and there was no designated radio operator.
483. Brock in room in Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo on leave with Connors. Money, pictures, comb, ashtray visible on table. These pictures may have come from film that he brought with him to have developed. Brock is in his dress khaki uniform; olive drab (O.D."s) would have been worn for winter. Connors was in Brock's squad (same tent & same missions).
484. Brock pictured at Fort Leonard Wood in front of barracks or recreation area. He is in his olive drab uniform, so it is winter. He hasn't been given his unit assignment yet; his uniform only has brass buttons that say "U.S." On Sundays, when they couldn't go home, soldiers would use the recreation area as a place to write letters, read, or make pictures at a little photo booth that would spit out a strip of pictures.
485. Brock resting and recuperating in Tokyo at the Civil Service Hotel. The hotel was staffed by Americans. The soldiers were able to pick their hotel; this one was not in downtown Tokyo. Traffic and chaos were terrible in Tokyo. Brock recounts that Japanese drivers drove all over the highway, with one hand on the horn and one hand on the steering wheel.
486. Photo taken on the western front of the Korean War in the Kumhwa region. On the hill were bunkers on the MLR (main line of resistance). Camouflage nets to inhibit the enemy's view can be seen in this photo.
487. The main line of resistance (MLR) is defined as the line or zone of contact with the enemy; it is also referred to as the front or front lines. In the Korean War, the area known as no man's land separated the fronts of the two sides. It was heavily mined and contained trip flares to alert military forces to enemy penetration. The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the MLR. A combat engineer seeks to advance his dual mission of keeping armies moving to attack, and impeding the enemy. In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. Brock's Company D of the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, though attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, possessed more mobility than other companies of the 2nd Engineers. Squads from Company D made up of ten to twelve men were generally sent out from base camp on location to tackle necessary construction, repair, and demolition assignments. When near the front, however, the company, like the rest of the 2nd Engineers, remained on call twenty-four hours a day. During this time, these soldiers often labored all day on engineer projects and at night were called to the front lines when the enemy tried to break through. Brock experienced the fiercest fighting as a combat infantryman and in conjunction with his engineer work in the Hook sector of the MLR near the Samichon River. This would have been the time of the bloody last battle of the Hook in July of 1953.
488. At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away. Brock'served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War. He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division "Second to None". His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea's Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips. They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee. In June of 1966, they were blessed with twin daughters, Darla and Karla. Brock is a longtime faithful member of the Findlay United Methodist Church. After thirty-five years of devoted service, he retired from Mallory Controls in Sparta.

490. An option American judges occasionally offered to the convicted in the Korean War era was joining the military in lieu of incarceration. President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 3000 provided service incentive for lawbreakers, as well. The order, issued in December of 1952, granted a full pardon to anyone convicted of violating any U.S. law who served in the military for at least one year and was honorably discharged.
491. Ohio soldier Carl Langley stands in front of the squad's tent straddling a rocket launcher at the Chorwon Valley base camp. Langley was in Brock's company but not his squad. Langley was in a vehicle accident where he was deemed criminally at fault and was given the choice of prison or the military. Langley didn't write home, and his parents contacted the Red Cross. The company commander ordered Langley to write a letter home every week and bring to the commander to mail.
492. This image depicts the back side of the front. A number of bunkers are shown, and an Army truck is at the base of the hill. One of the structures may be a medic area. Partially visible are caves, rock reinforcement of the area, and a road up to the hill to supply soldiers on the front in the bunkers. There may be a man standing on top of the hill in this image.
493. Brock in the foreground in front of someone's base camp; it is not his company's. They are up on a ridge in Korea--not near the front. This may be the location where Brock went about three times for dental work. It was staffed by America military dentists. Brock thought he had the mumps, but his bottom wisdom teeth were coming in. His wisdom teeth came in while he was in Korea.
494. Brock straddling a rocket launcher (bazooka) in front of his squad's tent.  .30 caliber and  .50 caliber machine guns are positioned near the 3rd Squad, 1st Platoon sign. This is Chorwon Valley. The squad's weapons were left like this in front of the tent, so they could grab them and be taken in at night. Each soldier had an assigned weapon. Brock's was this rocket launcher. Engineers always had their pistols and M-1s when working; they only had this heavy stuff with them when they were going to use it.
495. Preparing to do some engineer work are (from left to right) Austin, from Virginia, standing in front of tripod of M-1 rifles; next Carl Langley, from Ohio; then Martinez, from Michigan. Canteens are hooked over the rifles. Austin was not only in Brock's company, but also in his squad (same tent & same missions).
496. .30 caliber bazooka or rocket launcher. Camouflage netting pictured above. Netting usually used where soldiers were in danger of getting shot at; it blurred the enemy's vision.
497. Pictured are weapons that fall into the category of small arms. These weapons resided outside the squad tents of the combat engineers to be scooped up by the individual assigned to the particular weapon if he were called upon to function as a combat infantryman. Most of the small arms, individual or crew-served weapons, utilized by Americans or Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers in the Korean War were U.S. standard issue leftovers from World War II. The light machine gun is a tripod-mounted, belt-fed  .30 caliber air-cooled Browning, devoid of shoulder stock (likely the M-1919A4). In the Korean War, the 3.5-inch rocket launcher (bazooka) proved the standard anti-tank weapon; the measurement indicates the diameter of the launching tube. The aluminum bazooka launched a 23-inch long, 8 pound shape-charged rocket capable of piercing the armor of any contemporary tank and detrimental when deployed against enemy fortifications. Delayed in development after World War II, this rocket launcher and its ammunition went into production fifteen days before the start of the Korean War. The weapon was first airlifted to Korea on July 10, 1950. The previously fielded 2.36-inch model had proven ineffective in World War II and bitterly disappointed the infantrymen of Task Force Smith in the early days of the war with its inability to pierce the armor of North Korean T-34 tanks.
498. As a soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a Demolitions Specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all Combat Engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. The summer of 1952 found Dog Company on the line west of Chorwon repairing heavy monsoon damage to roads and bridges, mass producing prefabricated log bunkers for the 2nd Division through Operation Abe Lincoln, and designing a new mobile attack bunker for the infantry that could be quickly assembled for overhead cover and protection. The 2nd Engineers also laid minefields, tactical wire, napalm and booby traps, often under mortar and artillery fire, to strengthen the hill outposts of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Arrowhead Ridge. Attention was then turned to improving supply routes and shelter and installation construction for the winter. After coming out of reserve in late January of 1953, the 2nd Engineers supported infantry regiments in battle positions in the British Commonwealth section. Company D maintained the main supply routes to the front, in general support of the division, and continued to build bunkers for the 2nd Infantry Division. Another stint in reserve was followed by more support of the 2nd Division by the battalion beginning in July of 1953 in the Chorwon-Kumhwa sector. Here engineers often confronted enemy patrols and heavy mortar, artillery, and sniper fire. Toward the close of the war, Company D worked as engineers during the day and served as blocking infantry at night at the position known as The Hook.  During the American Revolution, George Washington appointed the first engineer officers, and engineers have served in combat in all the wars to follow. The 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion identifies as its parent unit the Battalion of Engineers, initially organized on August 3, 1861. Prior to the Korean War, the 2nd Engineers and its lineage had been awarded campaign streamers from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II. In the Korean War, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion protected the retreating Eighth Army and 2nd Infantry Division at Kunu-ri when U.S. and U.N. troops were surprised and overrun by the Chinese in late fall of 1950. As a result of a missed communication, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was left as the last unit in opposition to the Chinese onslaught and was decimated on November 30, 1950.

500. Despite countless examples of brave and devoted military service throughout American history, African Americans continued to face discrimination and segregation in the ranks of the U.S. military on the eve of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Issued in July of 1948, the order set up a presidential oversight commission to work with the military on plans to integrate the branches of service, but black soldiers still served in racially segregated units with virtually all white senior officers when the conflict began in June of 1950. Bloodletting on the battlefields of Korea opened the door for the desegregation of the military. Replacement soldiers were urgently needed in the early days, regardless of the color of their skin. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. As of October of 1951, black units were officially closed out, and the average U.S. Army unit became composed of 12% African American soldiers. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. By July of 1953, over 90% of black soldiers were serving in integrated units. An estimated 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the Korean War; roughly 9.3% of Americans killed in Korea were African American. The U.S. Army announced in 1954 that all its units were finally fully integrated. At war's end, African Americans had distinguished themselves with numerous awards derived from courage displayed on the ground and in the air. Though future battles remained regarding discrimination in the military with assignments, promotions, and military justice, African American Korean War soldiers had exhibited their leadership in command positions and showcased their abilities to serve admirably in elite and technical specialty units during the course of the war. Hispanic Americans also had a history of distinguishing themselves in combat in American history, as well as a history of continued discrimination and prejudice exhibited toward them in the armed forces. Over the course of the Korean War, nearly 148,000 Hispanic Americans volunteered or were drafted into military service, many fighting with the legendary Third Infantry Division's 65th Infantry Regiment "The Borinqueneers." Nine Hispanic Americans received the Congressional Medal of Honor for their displays of heroism during the Korean War.
501. On the left is a soldier named Rocky. The soldier on the right is unknown. This is the Chorwon Valley, the first place that Brock's company was stationed. There are weapons at the corner of the squad tent again--machine gun, bazooka, and a box of ammunition.
502. John Perdedas, Brock's fellow soldier, is pictured at the company's base camp in front of a chesnut orchard in the Kumhwa region.  Perdedas hailed from a country in Eastern Europe that was taken over by Russia after World War II (possibly Latvia). As a young man, he was involved in resistance against the Germans in WWII. He came to America and joined the military to gain his citizenship.
503. Brock posing in front of empty 155's shell casings. The location is uncertain. There were thousands ricked up like wood. Most were cardboard containers. Most of the brass shell casings were kept and sent back to the United States, but the Koreans loved to get the brass ones to make jewelry, furniture, etc. Brock is wearing his Dog Company (Company D) t-shirt.
504. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement." During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest monthly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacement combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
505. The location is the company's base camp at the Hook, the last place Brock was stationed. At this washstand, men shaved and washed up; there were no showers here. The front is positioned a few miles directly behind these men. Brock's fellow Company D soldiers are pictured. Connors, from Texas, is banging on the guitar. Austin is on the left; he is from Virginia. There is a jeep driving on the base camp road in this image. The tents are in a line in front of these men. Austin and Connors were not only in Brock's company, but also in his squad (same tent & same missions).
506. This picture is taken at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Brock is in engineer training at this point. He is standing beside the barracks at the water tower in his olive drab (OD's) dress uniform. This is probably on a Sunday, when he would have time to pose for a photograph.
507. Brock is sitting on High Rock, a noted formation that overlooks a road that Civil War soldiers traveled.
508. Brock is on the left. Robert L. Borders from Brock's squad is on the right. This is a  .50 caliber machine gun in the image. They are near the base camp, since they are not wearing helmets. Borders is serving as the ammo bearer here. One soldier carries the weapon in battle, and one carries the ammo because they would use so much of it.
509. Despite countless examples of brave and devoted military service throughout American history, African Americans continued to face discrimination and segregation in the ranks of the U.S. military on the eve of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S.

511. Location on the western front of the Korean War in the Kumhwa region. There is camouflage netting over this whole road to conceal the soldiers and keep them from getting shot at by the enemy.
512. Born in 1933 into a family of Tennessee sharecroppers at the height of the Great Depression, Laura Mae Phillips experienced sacrifice and hardship early in life. Phillips captured the attention of David Franklin Brock when they were teenagers, and he was immediately smitten. The two were sweethearts throughout the course of his service in the Korean War. Phillips's combined fear of commitment and delight in playing hard to get, however, led to her absenting herself several times when Brock came home on leave from training at Fort Leonard Wood and to her heading north for work in a Detroit spark plug factory while Brock was overseas. When Brock returned stateside in 1953, he renewed his courtship of Phillips, and they married in 1954.
513. Brock's girlfriend, whom he would later marry, Laura Mae Phillips, has written across the photo, "A Bad place Koera" [sic]. This is the MLR (main line of resistance) on the western front in the Kumhwa region. Located at the top of the hill are bunkers and trenches.
514. Brock pictured at High Rock in Van Buren County, a noted formation that overlooks a road that Civil War soldiers traveled.
515. Brock at Fort Leonard Wood. Trainees have been out bivouacing. On his back is a pup tent. Soldiers had to sleep on the ground under the tent. The tent leaked if touched and collapsed easily. Water came in under the soldier's sleeping bag. The tent had to be rolled up and packed just right, or the commanders would "gig" the soldier--take away his pass as punishment. Photo taken at the base of the water tank. Brock's girlfriend, Laura Mae Phillips, whom he would later marry, has written "My Man" on photo.
516. Brock propped up on his helmet (with two stripes denoting his rank of corporal); he is resting while out doing road work. His cigarette is lying on a rock beside him. He has his bayonet at his side. He had an extra one to go on his carbine. A ring can be seen on his finger. He wore a birthstone ring while working, but he got it hung on a bolt on the side of an engineer truck and barely got loose. He then mailed rings and effects home. The parcel was misdirected to Alabama, but got back to his mom because it was thought he had been killed.
517. As a Korean War soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. Brock's in-theater service occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. Brock'served his country from January 1952 to October 1953 and was promoted to corporal. He came home to Van Buren County on active reserve.
518. Brock in fatigues lying on a lawn with his 2nd Division patch visible. He is wearing his cap with his engineer's pin on it. The building is a mystery. It looks like a military barracks, but Brock cannot remember where it was.
519. Armor units (tanks) for the infantry divisions of the United States Army at the time of the Korean War were organized with a heavy tank battalion dedicated to a division and a tank company dedicated to a regiment. In addition, during the Korean War, the Army employed divisional reconnaissance companies and made sporadic use of several detached tank companies. When the conflict began, the absence of tank units in the Republic of Korea Army and the delay in getting Allied tanks comparable to the North Korean People's Army Russian-made T-34 tanks to the field meant that the superiority of enemy tanks figured heavily in the disastrous early Korean War clashes in July and August of 1950. The Second Infantry Division's 72nd Medium Tank Battalion came ashore in August of 1950 with a combination of M-26 Pershings and M-4A3E8 Shermans. Past this point in time, the major function of the tank units in the Korean War would be confined to infantry support. The M-4 Sherman tank, as with many of the small arms and artillery systems of the Korean War, was a hold-over from World War II. The Sherman tank went into service in 1942 and obtained iconic status and long-term, world-wide usage given its ease of production and repair, mechanical reliability, simplicity of operation, and relatively well-armored and well-armed state. The slopes, bogs, and rice paddies of Korea posed a challenge for some drivers of the M-4, but the larger drawbacks for this 400-horsepower gasoline-fueled workhorse were the comparatively thin armor and propensity to explode when hit, mainly due to the onboard stowage of ammunition propellant charges. The M-4 Sherman saw action throughout the Korean War and remained a mainstay with the United States military until it was replaced by the M48 Patton during the 1950s.
520. This appears to be one of Brock's photos that had been exposed to X-rays when shipped home. He had perhaps six rolls of film of big self-propelled guns and heavy armaments. It was a hobby of Brock's to photograph them on his travels. The Army really did not want them photographed, but he had a camera with him all the time, and when he met up with equipment on the road, he would snap. This is a Patton tank. He mailed film home a month or two before being sent home himself; the film was x-rayed, and very few images from those rolls survived.
521. Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at civil service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.
522. Photo taken of Brock in Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo while Brock was on R&R with Connors. Image of Connors floats over photo. Brock's girlfriend, Laura Mae Phillips, whom he would later marry, has written across the photo "honted" [sic--haunted].
523. Martinez from Michigan on the left, and Robbie from Wisconsin on the right. Robbie was a jeep driver. Both are holding their M-1's. Location is not near the front; they do not have on flak jackets, but they are wearing their helmets. Robbie was in Brock's squad (same tent & same missions).
524. He is wearing one of the jackets that he purchased in Japan and sent home. He also does not remember ever having sunglasses while in Korea.
525. Korean War soldiers were met with a unique experience as they came back to the United States from their service overseas. Due to the nature of the points rotation system, the troops did not return en masse, as was the case in previous American military conflicts. The lack of an official declaration of war; the absence of home front participation in the form of sacrifice; the waning popularity of the Korean War as it progressed; and the dearth of welcome home ceremonies, parades, and pomp undermined the position of Korean War veterans in the nation's consciousness and combined to further the notion that only tempered gratitude was being extended to these veterans. Their war became known as the forgotten one, and they have been referred to as the "silent generation," for they quietly served their country and re-entered a prosperous American society. These veterans, unlike others of past generations, were encouraged by the collective attitude of American society at the time to put their war experiences behind them. Given the lack of recognition and overt appreciation demonstrated for these Korean War veterans, the fact that any difficulties with post-war adjustment would be suffered bravely and in silence is not surprising. Brock recalls after the war having abandoned his life-long ambition of farming the family land in Van Buren County and riding around aimlessly in his newly-purchased car for a while, wasting his time and saved military pay in an attempt to "cool down."  Raised during the Great Depression and World War II on sacrifice and patriotism, this generation was asked to throw its shoulders back and march with the rest of the nation into the anticipated progress of the future decades.  The battles of Vietnam veterans to gain benefits and raise consciousness of their struggles, however, galvanized Korean War veterans to unite and seek delayed benefits, assistance with war-related issues, recognition, and the status befitting their service.
526. Photo of Brock with Billy Wallace, who is in his Air Force dress uniform. Wallace's family lived across from the Brocks on the other side of Cane Creek in Van Buren County. Wallace is posing in front of his car. This was one weekend when Brock was visiting home from training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The photo was taken at the Brock's old home place in the Cane Creek Community near Cummingsville. Ft. Leonard Wood exercise (PT) instructor would charge $15 to drive the guys to Nashville and drop them at the Greyhound Bus Station. Brock's girlfriend, Laura Mae Phillips, whom he would later marry, has written across the photo "To Sweet Gi" [sic--Two Sweet GI's].
527. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook.

528. Corporal David Franklin Brock at the Hook base camp. Brock is wearing fatigues with his helmet to the side. Further back between the hills behind him were Long Toms--long barrelled, long-range artillery; batteries of them would be grouped up at the front. They could lay down a solid streak of fire. In the daytime, they would make smoke rings when fired; at nighttime, they would make fire rings in the sky.
529. Carl Langley, a soldier in Brock's company, posing by empty 155's shell casings. The location is uncertain. There were thousands ricked up like wood. Most were cardboard containers. Most of the brass shell casings were kept and sent back to the United States, but the Koreans loved to get the brass ones to make jewelry, furniture, etc.
530. The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the main line of resistance (MLR). Stacks of empty artillery and mortar shell casings were the residue of artillery barrages at the front during this time period. Fifty-four battalions of field artillery were deployed by the United States to Korea, and it has been said that artillery proved the "King of Battle" for United Nations forces in this conflict. The use of heavy artillery escalated as the war dragged on. In comparison, July of 1953 found the enemy firing 375,565 artillery rounds at the Allied front; United Nations forces countered that same month with 2,000,982 rounds.
531. Here engineers are seen building a special bunker for a general. The ones for the front were built out of raw material to fit together like a puzzle. This one was special. It had 12 x 12 posts and was being built out of high-price 4 x 12 pine. The whole squad, plus others, were in on this build. Brock remembers working with a 2-man saw and getting over-balanced. He and the other soldier had to throw the saw down the hill to avoid being dragged down the hill with it.
532. Brock's fellow soldier, Carl Langley, is pictured in front of their Chorwon Valley mess hall. Logs anchored in the ground serve to keep soil from washing away with the rains, and they can be used as seating for eating or watching movies outside. Brock's company got to this base camp just in time for monsoon season. A week or two after they arrived, the rains washed out the roads and a bridge for the air strip.
533. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement.  During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest monthly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacement combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
534. Brock's girlfriend, Laura Mae Phillips, whom he later married, has written across this image of Brock "My Man." This photo may have been taken near a silver mine in South Korea. When the North Koreans invaded, they tried to extract as much of the resources as possible from South Korea.
535. Despite countless examples of brave and devoted military service throughout American history, African Americans continued to face discrimination and segregation in the ranks of the U.S. military on the eve of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order No. 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Issued in July of 1948, the order set up a presidential oversight commission to work with the military on plans to integrate the branches of service, but black soldiers still served in racially segregated units with virtually all white senior officers when the conflict began in June of 1950. Bloodletting on the battlefields of Korea opened the door for the desegregation of the military. Replacement soldiers were urgently needed in the early days, regardless of the color of their skin. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. As of October of 1951, black units were officially closed out, and the average U.S. Army unit became composed of 12% African American soldiers. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. By July of 1953, over 90% of black soldiers were serving in integrated units. An estimated 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the Korean War; roughly 9.3% of Americans killed in Korea were African American. The U.S. Army announced in 1954 that all its units were finally fully integrated. At war's end, African Americans had distinguished themselves with numerous awards derived from courage displayed on the ground and in the air. Though future battles remained regarding discrimination in the military with assignments, promotions, and military justice, African American Korean War soldiers had exhibited their leadership in command positions and showcased their abilities to serve admirably in elite and technical specialty units during the course of the war. Hispanic Americans also had a history of distinguishing themselves in combat in American history, as well as a history of continued discrimination and prejudice exhibited toward them in the armed forces. Over the course of the Korean War, nearly 148,000 Hispanic Americans volunteered or were drafted into military service, many fighting with the legendary Third Infantry Division's 65th Infantry Regiment "The Borinqueneers." Nine Hispanic Americans received the Congressional Medal of Honor for their displays of heroism during the Korean War.
536. Photo taken in the Chorwon Valley at a bunker fabrication site. Logs are being notched and cut to make bunkers to be assembled at the front. The logs were numbered and fit together like a puzzle. This is a location outside of a base camp, where timbers were brought in. These bunkers were being built for the whole 2nd Division. Martinez is on the left, and Robbie is on the right in the foreground of this shot. Robbie was the jeep driver and in Brock's squad (same tent & missions).
537. Martinez is on the left; Brock on the right. Brock has his Dog Company (Company D) t-shirt on, and a cigarette in hand. They are near a base camp-- a safe area-- because no weapons are near. Cigarettes were $1 a carton in Korea. Brock started smoking in basic training and smoked heavily in Korea. He eventually smoked four packs a day in Korea. Brock would quit when he was diagnosed with a bleeding ulcer in 1964.
538. Brock in front of the 2nd Division Orphanage--referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home. It was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock is pictured with the 2nd Division emblem. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
539. Over the course of its history, the Second Indianhead Infantry Division has fought in four wars, obtained over twenty campaign participation credits, and has yielded forty Medal of Honor recipients. The Division organized on October 26, 1917 at Bourmont, Haute Marne, France, and first saw combat in the Battle of Belleau Wood. The Second engaged in six Western Front campaigns during World War I, stood the most decorated American Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) at the end of the fighting, and sported what was termed the most coveted shoulder flash of the AEF. Based out of Fort Sam Houston at San Antonio at the time, the Indianhead Division was one of only three divisions remaining intact and on active duty throughout the interwar period. World War II found the Tomahawk Warriors going ashore at Normandy and fighting in six European campaigns. The Second Division proved the first unit sailing from the United States to reach Korea following the outbreak of hostilities in the summer of 1950. The Warrior Division was the first to break out of the Pusan Perimeter; led the Eighth Army drive to the Manchurian Border; at a terrible cost, protected the Eighth Army in its withdrawal upon Chinese intervention in November of 1950; and triumphed in the February 1951 Battle of Chipyong-ni, considered by many the turning point of the war. The unit helped defeat the enemy's spring offensive of 1951 and continued to fight outpost and hilltop battles until the conclusion of the conflict. In July of 1965, the Division returned to be stationed in South Korea as the Second Infantry Division/ROK-U.S. Combined Division with a mission of guard the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and help maintain peace in the region. The distinctive nickname and shoulder sleeve insignia of the Second Division grew out of a contest initiated by 2nd Supply Trains Commander Colonel William F. Herringshaw to produce a design to emblazon the Division's trucks. A combination of the winning designs (1st place an Indian Head and 2nd place a star) yielded the accepted vehicle insignia. Toward the end of the year, the design was chosen for the Division's shoulder patch, incorporating specifically the sculpted Indian Head appearing on the American five dollar gold piece. A total of forty-four variations of the insignia sprang up to denote different components of the Division, until a June 1920 directive deemed the design for all Indianhead Division personnel to be a black shield with a white star and Indian Head.
540. Location pictured is the Chorwon Reservoir. The electric tower is located on the northern side. No water can be seen in this image. The site appears to have been bombed and drained to cut off electricity to the area.
541. 2nd Division Orphanage--referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home. It was built in June of 1952 at Chongpyong-ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported there by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating. A South Korean man is standing at the entrance. Brock's girlfriend, Laura Mae Phillips, whom he later married, has written across the photograph "A nice looking place."
542. A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home. Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised. Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952. The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room. Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman. The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed. The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping. Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy, washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well. Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen. With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70 percent of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II's percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans. These children garnered the label "dust of the street", having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger. American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.
543. Brock on the left, and Martinez on the right at the bunker fabrication site. Brock has one hand at his waist and one arm slung over Martinez's shoulders. Pictured in the image are trucks and bunkers and logs.
544. Blurry image of soldiers either having classes or having church. Brock believes it to be church. Soldiers would be out working, and they would be asked if they wanted to go to a church service. A truck driver would then take them to the gathering place.
545. This fuzzy image likely depicts a typical field service during the Korean War. Korean War chaplains and chaplain assistants navigated the challenging terrain of Korea to minister to the spiritual needs of the soldiers at the front. With their chaplain kits, they could hastily assemble an altar atop the hood of a jeep or even on ammunition crates. They often carried with them, as well, field organs, Bibles, and hymnbooks to utilize in these impromptu religious services. Fifteen United Nations (UN) countries had chaplains serving in the Korean War. When the conflict began, the United States Army responded to the intense need for chaplains by employing the reserve, issuing individual recalls of World War II chaplains, and recruiting, though the authorized number of chaplains was never met. Roughly 1,600 U.S. Army chaplains served throughout the course of the Korean War; the maximum number remained around three hundred at any given time. American and Korean civilians augmented these numbers by functioning as auxiliary chaplains. In addition to conducting nondenominational worship services, U.S. Army chaplains were tasked with protecting free exercise rights of soldiers and the rights of those without a faith, providing counseling and moral support, and maintaining troop morale. Chaplains might administer last rites, conduct memorial services for fallen soldiers, write death notifications for families, transmit messages to and from home through the Red Cross, convey health education, operate circulating libraries, and arrange sporting and recreational activities for the soldiers. Chaplains were stationed at U.S. military hospitals in Japan, on UN hospital ships, in military camps, and attached to mobile hospitals, in addition to traveling from unit to unit with the troops along the front. As chaplains comforted, ministered to and protected the wounded on the front lines, they often placed themselves in harm's way. Thirteen U.S. chaplains died as a result of enemy action, twenty-six were wounded; of the four chaplains captured by the enemy, none survived the experience. The Korean War saw twenty-two chaplains receive the Silver Star medal. July 29, 2016 marked the 241st birthday of the Chaplain Corps of the United States Army, with over 25,000 chaplains having served in more than 270 major wars and combat engagements. The Chaplain Corps was established in 1775, and today, it is comprised of 2,700 clergy members and represents over a hundred religious denominations.
546. Brock at Fort Leonard Wood. He is squatting down by a tree in front of the barracks. Since he has on winter clothing, he is probably still in infantry training.
547. This is the western front of the Korean War, the MLR--main line of resistance. Minefields are marked and have fences around them. Part of a fence can be seen in this image, so this may be a minefield.
548. Brock's fellow soldier Carl Langley is pictured with a canteen cup in his hand. He has on no helmet, so he is in a relatively safe area.
549. Brock is pictured at Fort Leonard Wood, where he took his training. He is in his dress khakis. The training field is behind him.
550. Brock seated at a table in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo while on leave. He is wearing his OD's (olive drab uniform). Looks like two camera cases in the background. He is in a double room with fellow soldier Connors. Connors is in Brock's squad. This R&R, the only one that Brock took while in Korea, lasted one week.
551. Brock's company is moving back toward the front. They finished in the Chorwon Valley, have spent 30 days in reserve, and are now moving up to Kumhwa. Soldiers are pictured standing next to jeeps and trailers on the road. Items being loaded or unloaded appear in the foreground.
552. There is an unidentified soldier pictured in the foreground. A quonset hut is visible in the background; this rounded, metal building served as a more permanent structure. It was often used for official business, like storing records or for medical staffing. There is also a stone wall and fencing--another indication this base is not a movable one. The area is more than ten miles from the front and out of the range of artillery shells.
553. As a soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a Demolitions Specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all Combat Engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. The summer of 1952 found Dog Company on the line west of Chorwon repairing heavy monsoon damage to roads and bridges, mass producing prefabricated log bunkers for the 2nd Division through Operation Abe Lincoln, and designing a new mobile attack bunker for the infantry that could be quickly assembled for overhead cover and protection. The 2nd Engineers also laid minefields, tactical wire, napalm and booby traps, often under mortar and artillery fire, to strengthen the hill outposts of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Arrowhead Ridge. Attention was then turned to improving supply routes and shelter and installation construction for the winter. After coming out of reserve in late January of 1953, the 2nd Engineers supported infantry regiments in battle positions in the British Commonwealth section. Company D maintained the main supply routes to the front, in general support of the division, and continued to build bunkers for the 2nd Infantry Division. Another stint in reserve was followed by more support of the 2nd Division by the battalion beginning in July of 1953 in the Chorwon-Kumhwa sector. Here engineers often confronted enemy patrols and heavy mortar, artillery, and sniper fire. Toward the close of the war, Company D worked as engineers during the day and served as blocking infantry at night at the position known as The Hook.  During the American Revolution, George Washington appointed the first engineer officers, and engineers have served in combat in all the wars to follow. The 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion identifies as its parent unit the Battalion of Engineers, initially organized on August 3, 1861. Prior to the Korean War, the 2nd Engineers and its lineage had been awarded campaign streamers from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II. In the Korean War, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion protected the retreating Eighth Army and 2nd Infantry Division at Kunu-Ri when U.S. and U.N. troops were surprised and overrun by the Chinese in late fall of 1950. As a result of a missed communication, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was left as the last unit in opposition to the Chinese onslaught and was decimated on November 30, 1950.
554. Brock, without a helmet, is out working on the roads and is leaning against a dirt bank. He has his engineer's cap on, (He usually had it on under his helmet, too.) and has his engineer's pin on the cap. He has a ring on each hand, so this is before he got his ring hung on the side of an engineer truck as he was getting down and was in danger of being dragged; he sent all his rings home after that.
555. Brock's fellow soldier, Carl Langley, is on the right; an unidentified soldier is on the left. These engineers are building a bunker in a safe area for a general. It is located out of range, so they don't have their helmets on. It will be sandbagged all around. It will be 4'' thick and 12'' wide, with 12" by 12" corner posts. Langley and the other soldier are taking a break, perched on the bunker they are building.
556. Brock is pictured on top of High Rock in Van Buren County. Doyle would be located a ways behind him. This photograph was taken before he went to Korea. It is said that Bragg's army traveled the road that passed by High Rock as they went South. The formation is located in Brennalee Hollow.
557. Brock sitting in his hotel room in the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo while on leave. His olive drab uniform is minus his coat. On the table, money and an ashtray are visible. Camera bags are on the dresser behind him.
558. This is somewhere in the Kumhwa area near the front. Brock is standing in the middle of the road with helmet and flak jacket on; he has a cigarette in his left hand. There are five more soldiers in the background. They were probably sent out as a squad to accomplish a project. There would be a squad leader, a medic, a truck driver, and a demolition guy (Brock). Brock was the demolitions specialist for the whole company. The specialist would have an assistant to train for when he left Korea.
559. Brock in hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo while on leave. He is dressed in his uniform to go into the city of Tokyo or to leave.The camera bags are on the back of the dresser. He may have been all packed to leave the hotel.
560. Brock posing with a mallard duck at a little lake located behind the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo. Brock is on a one-week leave along with fellow soldier Connors. Brock is dressed in his OD's (olive drab dress uniform), minus his jacket.
561. Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with new uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at civil service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.

565. Brock'stretched out on a bed in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo where he spent his one-week leave. A phone is visible. This may have been one of the nights he and fellow soldier Connors called downstairs to the wine bar to have them send up wine to the room.
566. Brock posing in front of empty shell casings for artillery rounds that are stacked like ricks of wood. All of them would have been fired at this location. Most of them were cardboard; the metal ones would have been retained. This is a different location than the image of Brock in the t-shirt in front of the shell casings.
567. The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the main line of resistance (MLR). Stacks of empty artillery and mortar shell casings were the residue of artillery barrages at the front during this time period. Fifty-four battalions of field artillery were deployed by the United States to Korea, and it has been said that artillery proved the King of Battle for United Nations forces in this conflict. The use of heavy artillery escalated as the war dragged on. In comparison, July of 1953 found the enemy firing 375,565 artillery rounds at the Allied front; United Nations forces countered that same month with 2,000,982 rounds.
568. Brock in the garden behind the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo where he spent his one-week leave. He is in his OD's (olive drab dress uniform), minus his jacket.
569. Globemasters joined the other types of propeller-driven transport aircraft toward the end of the Korean War. Compared to the more common C-54 Skymasters and C-119 Flying Boxcars, the C-124 Globemasters were giants. The Globemasters were utilized in both of the two categories of Korean War transport aircraft, the tactical (intratheater) airlift of the Far East Air Force (FEAF) Combat Cargo Command and the strategic (intercontinental) airlift of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS). The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.
570. Pictured is a C-124 Globemaster four-engine plane at a military airstrip in Korea. Tanks could be driven into the open front of the plane; it was three-decks high inside the cargo hold. This plane is surrounded by hospital ambulances. Possibly the wounded are being picked up from this location. Brock flew in the same type of plane to Tokyo and back. The plane was 40,000 lbs. overweight and had mechanical trouble with an engine when taking off from Korea; the exact same plane carried Brock back to Korea from Japan following his R&R.
571. Brock with his arm slung around fellow soldier Connors in their hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo while on their one-week R&R leave. They are dressed in their t-shirts.
572. Brock is writing a letter while on leave in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo. He is dressed in his OD's (olive drab uniform), minus the jacket and cap. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.
573. Brock is in the Kumhwa area. The front is directly behind him, past the cloaking camouflage netting. He has his helmet on, his flak jacket, and is carrying his M-1. These rifles were used during World War II and were packed in cosmalean grease and left in Japan. It took a day or two to clean them out after they were issued. His cap is on under his helmet, with his engineer's pin attached to the bill. The cap probably had fur flaps.
574. This image of Brock conveys the harshness of both weather and terrain on the Korean peninsula and the dangers at the front lines faced by American soldiers in the Korean War. Winter brought temperatures often thirty degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
accompanied by heavy snow and bitter winds. These conditions produced frozen grounds and equipment, as well as frostbite. Some soldiers slept with guns to their chest to prevent their weapons from freezing up. Troops like Brock entering the theater in 1952, however, were infinitely better prepared, equipped and outfitted for cold weather than those facing the early and tragic winter of 1950-51. Humid, sweltering summers with temperatures often exceeding one hundred degrees Fahrenheit brought out disease, rats, and insects. Monsoon season washed out bridges and roads and flooded trenches, bunkers, and dugouts. Trucks and guns became bogged down and had to be pulled out of the resulting mud; soldiers caked in mud were also encumbered. The weather proved one foe of those waging war, and the terrain proved another. The topography of Korea is almost eighty percent mountainous. The landscape of rugged mountains, hills, and valleys resulted in few roads, narrow in nature.  Transversing even short distances under these conditions expended much time and effort for the armed forces; steep slopes and rice paddies filled with perhaps one hundred-year-old water challenged men, weapons, and vehicles. Military engineers had their work cut out for them, building up transportation networks for operations and supply and tackling river obstacles.The main line of resistance (MLR) is defined as the line or zone of contact with the enemy; it is also referred to as the front or front lines. In the Korean War, the area known as no man's land separated the fronts of the two sides. It was heavily mined and contained trip flares to alert military forces to enemy penetration. The front lines largely stabilized north of Seoul in 1951, and the final two years of the Korean War (1952/1953) represented a static ground phase characterized by battles for hills and outposts along the MLR. A combat engineer seeks to advance his dual mission of keeping armies moving to attack, and impeding the enemy. In the Korean War, combat engineer units rotated toward the front, often attached to combat infantry regiments to provide support. Brock's Company D of the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, though attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, possessed more mobility than other companies of the 2nd Engineers. Squads from Company D made up of ten to twelve men were generally sent out from base camp on location to tackle necessary construction, repair, and demolition assignments. When near the front, however, the company, like the rest of the 2nd Engineers, remained on call twenty-four hours a day. During this time, these soldiers often labored all day on engineer projects and at night were called to the front lines when the enemy tried to break through. Brock experienced the fiercest fighting as a combat infantryman and in conjunction with his engineer work in the Hook sector of the MLR near the Samichon River. This would have been the time of the bloody last battle of the Hook in July of 1953.
575. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at The Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
576. Camouflage netting is stretched over a medical or dental tent. There is a "No Smoking" sign at the entrance. A soldier is pictured standing at the entrance, and another soldier is going into the tent. They are dressed in t-shirts.
577. Brock standing outside at the Brock family farm. The barn is in the distance. The location is near Cummingsville in Van Buren County; it is the Cane Creek Community.
578. Brock in fatigues in the Kumhwa area. An orchard of chesnut trees appears behind him. Mess kits hanging up are visible. His hand is on a rocket launcher (or bazooka). There is a .30 caliber machine gun on a tripod sitting sideways. The stream running behind the orchard was a good place for the soldiers to swim, but it was also so full of gold, that it clogged up the water filters being used by the military.
579. Brock's fellow squad member Austin (same tent & same missions) is pictured in his fatigues. Austin hailed from Virginia. He is shown stretched across a ditch, taking a break from road building.

August 15, 1950 saw the agreement of the government of the Republic of Korea and the United Nations Command to place as many as one hundred South Korean soldiers in each U.S. company-sized unit of the Eighth Army, as an augmentation; thus, the KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) program was born. The Korean soldiers received basic training and then were assigned to American units to provide additional fire power. Though still legally under the Republic of Korea Army and under the administration of the Republic of Korea government, these soldiers were fed and equipped by the Eighth Army. In addition to introducing cultural and linguistic challenges into the ranks, according to Brock, the presence of the KATUSAs required other adjustments to be made; the M-1 rifle proved too large for the Korean soldiers, and instead they carried the older carbines. In some cases, as in Brock's company, the KATUSAs were integrated into the squads, thereby, sleeping, eating, and undertaking missions with American troops. In other cases, separate Korean platoons were formed. The 2nd Division placed the KATUSA personnel largely in infantry regiments and Division artillery, to function as riflemen, ammunition bearers, cannoneers, and the like. The KATUSAs, once seasoned, performed admirably. The French and Netherlands Battalions attached to the 2nd Infantry Division widely utilized these Korean soldiers. July of 1952 found further authorization for increasing the strength of the KATUSAs in the Eighth Army. At war's end, approximately 27,000 KATUSAs were serving alongside American soldiers. Today, they remain attached to the 2nd Division stationed in South Korea, and the value of their service is reflected in the current official designation of the Division: U.S. Army Second Infantry Division/ROK-US Combined Division.
581. The location is the company's base camp at the Hook, the last place Brock was stationed. At this washstand, men shaved and washed up; there were no showers here. The front is positioned a few miles directly behind Brock. Brock is pictured with African American soldier Robert L. Borders and South Korean soldier Le Bon Duc. Both soldiers were in Brock's squad (same tent & same missions).
582. Pictured is engineer John Perdedas. Perdedas hailed from a country in Eastern Europe that was taken over by Russia after World War II (possibly Latvia). As a young man, he was involved in resistance against the Germans in WWII. He came to America and joined the military to gain his citizenship. He is posed in front of an orchard of chesnut trees in the Kumhwa area.
583. Brock dressed in his training uniform (without unit designation). He is standing in front of a Greyhound bus. This is likely when he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood and would be coming to visit home on the weekends. The location would be the Nashville Greyhound Bus Station.
584. Photograph of David Franklin Brock with his girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips. This image was taken when Brock was home on a thirty-day leave after he had completed his military engineering training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and before he was shipped out to Korea. He has his engineer pin on his khaki uniform. The photo was made in Sparta by local photographer Frank England.
585. Brock sitting at a table in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo. He is all packed and ready to leave Tokyo for Korea after his one week of R&R. His girlfriend, whom he would later marry, Laura Mae Phillips, has written across the photograph "a wonderful man."
586. At an unknown location, Brock is standing outside a squad tent in a tank t-shirt. Mess kits hanging up are visible, along with clothes on the line. Camo netting is over the tent. The tent is dilapidated, but it does have a floor. There is another unidentified soldier in the doorway.
587. Brock's service in the Korean War occurred in the vicinity of the Iron Triangle and near the 38th parallel. During this time (from July of 1952 to the end of the war), the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was stationed at the Chorwon Valley, then in the Kumhwa region, and finally at the Hook. The 2nd Engineers set up base camps at these three stations and remained at each for approximately six months. The soldiers were a part of the rotation points system instituted in March of 1951 for all United Nations personnel. Service within different sectors garnered an assigned number of points per month, with more dangerous locations carrying a higher number of points. Assignments from the base camp would rotate closer toward the front and then back away. Thus, there were a certain number of days per month for which a soldier would receive extra combat pay. After extended periods of service near the front, the unit would be rotated to the rear, perhaps twenty-five miles from the lines, and placed in reserve for rest and additional training. Once a soldier had accumulated a certain number of points, he was eligible to return home; his position would be taken by a replacement. During 1952, the 2nd Division received an average of 1,800 replacements per month. The highest monthly total for the year of 3,000 replacements occurred in July of 1952--when Brock arrived in Korea as a replacment combat engineer. Though the rotation points system had the potential to heighten morale, it also could erode comradery and undermine unit allegiance with its notion of limited service. In Brock's case, it took fourteen months to obtain the necessary thirty-six points to leave Korea. When moving to a new station to set up a base camp, and thus, replace another unit, the 2nd Engineers might camp half a dozen times for a two-week period before reaching their final destination. With each stop, their supply of explosives, anti-personnel mines, and anti-tank mines had to be unloaded from trucks by the combat engineers and located a safe distance away from the main camp. Then, at the end of the two-week interval, these dangerous stores would be reloaded onto trucks, so the battalion could move out. When the 2nd Engineers arrived at the new station, the combat engineers could then deposit the explosives and mines at an adjacent site a safe distance away (usually on the side of a hill) for a period of months.
588. August 15, 1950 saw the agreement of the government of the Republic of Korea and the United Nations Command to place as many as one hundred South Korean soldiers in each U.S. company-sized unit of the Eighth Army, as an augmentation; thus, the KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) program was born. The Korean soldiers received basic training and then were assigned to American units to provide additional fire power. Though still legally under the Republic of Korea Army and under the administration of the Republic of Korea government, these soldiers were fed and equipped by the Eighth Army. In addition to introducing cultural and linguistic challenges into the ranks, according to Brock, the presence of the KATUSAs required other adjustments to be made; the M-1 rifle proved too large for the Korean soldiers, and instead they carried the older carbines. In some cases, as in Brock's company, the KATUSAs were integrated into the squads, thereby, sleeping, eating, and undertaking assignments with American troops. In other cases, separate Korean platoons were formed. The 2nd Division placed the KATUSA personnel largely in infantry regiments and Division artillery, to function as riflemen, ammunition bearers, cannoneers, and the like.

July of 1952 found further authorization for increasing the strength of the KATUSAs in the Eighth Army. At war's end, approximately 27,000 KATUSAs were serving alongside American soldiers. Today, they remain attached to the 2nd Division stationed in South Korea, and the value of their service is reflected in the current official designation of the Division: U.S. Army Second Infantry Division/ROK-US Combined Division.
589. Two men from Brock's company are pictured in front of the chesnut orchard in the Kumhwa area. One is a South Korean soldier and the other is African American.
590. Pictured left to right are Austin, with a cigarette and dog tags visible; Connors with guitar; and Robert L. Borders at the washpan grooming. These are all soldiers in Brock's squad (same tent & same missions). The location is the company's base camp at the Hook, the last place Brock was stationed. At this washstand, men shaved and washed up; there were no showers here. The front is positioned a few miles directly behind these men.
591. There would be a stark contrast between the military preparedness of the Army soldiers pictured in this image in 1952, and those facing the shock of combat on the Korean peninsula in the summer of 1950. At the beginning of the Korean War, the U.S. Army strength was 591,000 soldiers out of an authorized strength of 630,201. Post World War II Army leadership confronted rapid demobilization, huge manpower and defense budget cuts implemented by the Truman administration and Congress, lack of new equipment, the occupation demands of Germany and Japan, and uneven basic training cycles for new inductees. The repercussions of all these conditions came to bear on the members of the regular military, the reserves, and National Guard troops rushed into action after North Korean soldiers invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. Also, the desegregated nature of the unit pictured here contrasts with conditions in the military at the beginning of the Korean War. The battlefield pressure of the Korean War would become the catalyst for the full implementation of President Harry S. Truman's Executive Order No. 9981 that provided for the desegregation of the United States armed forces. Commander in Chief of the Far East Command General Matthew B. Ridgway began the total integration of U.S. Army combat units in Korea in the late summer and fall of 1951. In Brock's case, his military training program and housing at Fort Leonard Wood were racially integrated, as would be the squad tents of his combat engineer company, with black and white soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. Ground was broken in south-central Missouri for a major Army training facility, the Seventh Corps Area Training Center, on December 3, 1940. The War Department named the installation Fort Leonard Wood. The service of Major General Leonard Wood spanned forty years and included functioning as a surgeon in the Apache Indian Wars of the 1880s, initially commanding the Rough Riders in the Spanish American War, serving as the Army's Chief of Staff, and holding the position of Governor General of the Philippine Islands. The fort that would bear Major General Wood's name first served as a World War II infantry division training area, but soon became an engineer training site, as well. Three hundred thousand soldiers received instruction at Fort Leonard Wood during the course of World War II. Though designated an inactive post following World War II, the Army reopened Fort Leonard Wood in 1950 to supply basic and engineer training to soldiers of the Korean War. The mission of training as the cadre unit for Fort Leonard Wood at this time was given to the reactivated 6th Armored Division. After the Korean War, Fort Leonard Wood became a permanent post designated as the United States Army Training Center Engineer. Fort Leonard Wood garnered the United States Army Engineer School in the 1980s when it was moved from Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In the 1990s, Fort Leonard Wood also came to house the United States Army Military Police School and the United States Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear School. David Franklin Brock was drafted and entered the Army for training on January 21st of 1952. After staying a week at Fort Jackson, South Carolina and being issued clothing and uniforms, Brock arrived at Fort Leonard Wood and received approximately two months of infantry training followed by several months of engineer instruction. Brock boarded the troop transport USS General W.A. Mann at San Francisco in early July of 1952 to sail for Korea.
592. Training photograph of Brock's platoon from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri: 1st Platoon, Co. C, 86th Recon. Battalion, 6th Armd. Divi., Capt. Hugh P. Shaw C. O. (commanding officer). Note the presence of a number of African American soldiers in the platoon, indicating the racially integrated nature of military training for Korean War soldiers in the United States.
593. This is a road in Korea in the Kumhwa area. There is a hill leading up to the front. The road leading to the front is used as a supply route. The edge of a bunker and a vehicle behind it are barely visible.
594. This is on the western front next to the Hook, Brock's last station. There is fencing in the foreground, and there were minefields along the sides of the roads at this location. Brock's girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips, has written across the photo "Just Korea."
595. Unknown location in Korea. Brock is taking a break from working to smoke. He is not near the front, since he has no helmet--not even a cap.
596. Brock pictured at High Rock in Van Buren County. He is wearing a flannel shirt with a superhero t-shirt underneath.
597. Brock is pictured on the right. Possibly Martinez is the other soldier pictured working with his head down. A couple of pneumatic drills on stands with lines to them appear in the image. The two are drilling to lay dynamite or C-3. This is for road building. The other soldier is trying to loosen the drill bit to remove it from the hole--bits would get hung up. It took one hundred charges going off at one time to raise a roadbed to construct this road.
598. An encampment of several different units, possibly located between the Kumhwa region and the Hook. There are numerous vehicles in the photo. This is a temporary set-up.
599. This is an unidentified soldier standing sideways using binoculars to look at the other side of the front.
600. This is a photo of the back of a hill that is located on the western front near the Hook. A supply route road up to the front can be seen. A vehicle and big drums are visible; the drums might contain diesel fuel.
601. Open valley east of the Hook. These are the range of hills that surround the Hook.
602. Brock pictured at his company's first station in the Chorwon Valley. Brock is squatting down with a .30 caliber machine gun in front of him and a rocket launcher (bazooka) to his left. Brock's assigned weapon if called into combat was the rocket launcher.
603. Pictured are weapons that fall into the category of small arms. These weapons resided outside the squad tents of the combat engineers to be scooped up by the individual assigned to the particular weapon if he were called upon to function as a combat infantryman. Most of the small arms, individual or crew-served weapons, utilized by Americans or Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers in the Korean War were U.S. standard issue leftovers from World War II. The light machine gun is a tripod-mounted, belt-fed .30 caliber air-cooled Browning, devoid of shoulder stock (likely the M-1919A4). In the Korean War, the 3.5-inch rocket launcher (bazooka) proved the standard anti-tank weapon; the measurement indicates the diameter of the launching tube. The aluminum bazooka launched a 23-inch long, 8 pound shape-charged rocket capable of piercing the armor of any contemporary tank and detrimental when deployed against enemy fortifications. Delayed in development after World War II, this rocket launcher and its ammunition went into production fifteen days before the start of the Korean War. The weapon was first airlifted to Korea on July 10, 1950. The previously fielded 2.36-inch model had proven ineffective in World War II and bitterly disappointed the infantrymen of Task Force Smith in the early days of the war with its inability to pierce the armor of North Korean T-34 tanks.
604. An encampment of several different units, possibly located between the Kumhwa region and the Hook. This is a temporary set-up. There is a fuel depot with tents surrounding it. This type of supply would be kept away from the main camp in case it was hit.
605. Brock posing in front of a chesnut orchard in Kumhwa. This was during a time period when the engineers were heavily involved in road building. Engineer equipment is pictured behind Brock--trucks and trailers. Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
606. Brock and his girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips, are standing outside the Greyhound Bus Station in Nashville. Brock is wearing his OD (olive drab) training uniform, and is visiting with a weekend pass from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.
607. Brock and his girlfriend, whom he later married, Laura Mae Phillips, are squatting down beside a car outside the Greyhound Bus Station in Nashville. Brock is wearing his OD (olive drab) training uniform, and is visiting with a weekend pass from Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.
608. Brock is pictured at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri in front of his barracks, posing with his foot on the bumper of a car. He is wearing his training OD's (oliver drab dress uniform).
609. Brock is on a thirty-day furlough at home before he is sent to Korea. He has just completed his military engineer training at Fort Leonardwood, Missouri. He is posing for Frank England, a Sparta photographer, in his uniform that now displays all his unit designations.
610. Camouflage netting is stretched over a medical or dental tent. There is a "No Smoking" sign at the entrance. There is a Hispanic soldier in the foreground playing a guitar. There is a South Korean soldier in the background.
611. A Christmas tree with a cross on top and attached lights is pictured outside of a church or chapel. This is a cut tree; a stand can be seen. There is a church-shaped sign with "chapel" written on it, as well as other illegible info.
612. Image of Brock taken before he went to Korea. The photo was taken at the Johnson Photography Studio in Sparta.
613. Some engineers making wooden floors for tents in the financial district near Kumhwa--this was where the 2nd Division records were kept. There were lots of tents, a 5,000 watt generator, and ample supplies here. An engineer truck can be seen with a generator or air compressor possibly on the back of the truck. All of the engineers' tools ran off air compression--drills and the like.
614. Location pictured is a Korean miltary airport. This is a C-124 Globemaster plane taking off. It was the biggest transport airplane in the theater. This photo was probably taken as Brock and Connors were coming back from their R&R inTokyo. Brock likely took this photograph from inside his transport plane.
615. The occasion was the moving of the 2nd Division Engineers Supply Depot fifteen or twenty miles closer to the front. Brock's company was helping to relocate this facility. Brock remembers during their dinner breaks, the soldiers would watch the British Air Force fly vertically and create sonic booms. The location here was in the Kumwha region. The 1st Marine Division was on the west coast near the Hook.
616. In the image, a metal quonset hut is present. The lines are probably telephone lines. The occasion was the moving of the 2nd Division Engineers Supply Depot fifteen or twenty miles closer to the front. Brock's company was helping to relocate this facility. Brock remembers during their dinner breaks, the soldiers would watch the British Air Force fly vertically and create sonic booms. The location here was in the Kumhwa region. The 1st Marine Division was on the west coast near the Hook. Most other Engineer companies had certain locations they were assigned to. Brock's company was not tied down to serve a particular area; they could be sent anywhere.
617. Connors is on the left; Robert L. Borders is behind a  .50 caliber machine gun, and Brock is on the right. There is a squad tent behind them (10-15 men in each squad.). This is the Kumhwa district. Brock, Borders, and Connors are in the same squad (same tent & same missions).
618. Most of the small arms, individual or crew-served weapons, utilized by Americans or Republic of Korea (ROK) soldiers in the Korean War were U.S. standard issue leftovers from World War II.  The pictured Korean War era belt-fed Browning .50 caliber air-cooled M-1921M2HB heavy machine gun's history began with its 1921 origin date. Modifications were made to the original water-cooled version in the 1930s to produce an air-cooled Browning M2 still utilizing the huge .50 BMG ( Browning Machine Gun ) bullet-shaped cartridge fed through an ammunition belt. The 84-pound M2HB ( Heavy Barrel ) followed, and allowed the weapon to be fired longer without over-heating. With a range of 2,000 yards, this extremely versatile heavy machine gun became a classic weapon/cartridge combination throughout the world, and in the case of Brock's Korean War usage, provided superior infantry fire support when needed.
619. This location is in the Division rear, at least twenty miles from the front. Brock's squad is building something for the Division. Here they kept the financial records about allotments sent home by soldiers. This is when Brock was stationed in the Kumhwa district. Only the one squad went on this mission. Usually, Brock's squad got picked to travel, if there was only one squad needed.
620. This is the front or MLR (main line of resistance) close to the Hook. An American flag, a vehicle, and a bunker can be seen. Trenches were over the hill. The road pictured leads up to the front.
621. Engineers putting a floor together for tents in the financial district near Kumhwa; this was where the 2nd Division records were kept. The soldier in the image is unidentified.  There were lots of tents, a 5,000 watt generator, and ample supplies at this location.
622. This is a current photo of David Franklin Brock on the back deck of his home in Sparta, Tennessee. He is standing beside the American flag that means so much to him--the flag that he fought for in Korea.
623. At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away. Brock served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War. He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division "Second to None".  His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea's Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook, a bend on the Samichon River near the border between North and South Korea. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips. They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee. Besides recording the Korean War experiences of Corporal David Franklin Brock, this transcript figures in the initial efforts in 2011 of the Tennessee State Library and Archives to record the contributions of Tennessee's veterans of both the Korean War and the Vietnam War through an ongoing project entitled Tennessee Remembers. Tennessee Remembers seeks to honor the men and women who served in Korea and Vietnam by preserving as only an archives can the history of their wartime experiences. The goal of this project is to collect original documents, photographs, and memorabilia related to the in-country experiences of these veterans to be preserved for future generations and made accessible for research and educational purposes. As a part of Tennessee Remembers, the Tennessee State Library and Archives has developed a Korean War veterans and a Vietnam War veterans questionnaire that will give individuals an opportunity to document and preserve their war experiences for future generations.  In 2011, with the support of Secretary of State Tre Hargett and State Librarian and Archivist Chuck Sherrill, Dr. Wayne Moore headed a Veterans Committee made up of State Library and Archives staff members charged with designing questionnaires relevant to both groups of veterans. At the committee's request, Manuscripts Archivist Darla Brock posed selected questions from the U.S. Army Military History Institute's Korea War Era Service Survey Questionnaire to her father, Korean War veteran David Franklin Brock. His responses and reactions to these questions assisted the committee in designing the Korean War questionnaire. Similar connections were made with Christopher Ammons, a Vietnam War veteran, who donated a collection of materials to the Tennessee State Library and Archives. Beginning in the spring of 2011, staff videographer Todd Spainhour conducted filming for the project's promotion with these two veterans and Vietnam veterans Bud Alley and Tennessee State Representative David A. Shepard. The institution's Exhibits Committee, chaired by James Castro, also began planning for a veterans exhibit revolving around the donated materials of soldiers Brock and Ammons; Todd Spainhour headed up the Korean War exhibit (Forgotten War, Unforgettable Memories: The Korean War Experiences of Cpl. David Brock), and James Castro organized the Vietnam War exhibit (Counting the Days and Getting Short: The Vietnam War Experience of Christopher Ammons). By 2012, the questionnaires were available in print and on the State Library and Archives web site, and donations of materials were being received. A reception on November 9, 2012, in the Tennessee State Library & Archives Memorial Hall marked the opening of the dual exhibits honoring Korean War and Vietnam War veterans through the service of Brock and Ammons and promoting the Tennessee Remembers project. Secretary of State Tre Hargett presided over the ceremony, with David Franklin Brock and Christopher Ammons present. Commissioner of Veterans Affairs Many-Bears Grinder addressed the crowd that attended the opening as well. The Tennessee State Library and Archives continues to solicit donations to enrich its holdings and accept completed questionnaires from Korean War and Vietnam War veterans who were living in Tennessee at the time of the war or veterans who currently reside in Tennessee.

627. As a soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division’s 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire.  Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines.  As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier.  The summer of 1952 found Dog Company on the line west of Chorwon repairing heavy monsoon damage to roads and bridges, mass producing prefabricated log bunkers for the 2nd Division through Operation “Abe Lincoln,” and designing a new mobile attack bunker for the infantry that could be quickly assembled for overhead cover and protection.  The 2nd Engineers also laid minefields, tactical wire, napalm and booby traps, often under mortar and artillery fire, to strengthen the hill outposts of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Arrowhead Ridge.  Attention was then turned to improving supply routes and shelter and installation construction for the winter.  After coming out of reserve in late January of 1953, the 2nd Engineers supported infantry regiments in battle positions in the British Commonwealth section. Company D maintained the main supply routes to the front, in general support of the division, and continued to build bunkers for the 2nd Infantry Division.  Another stint in reserve was followed by more support of the 2nd Division by the battalion beginning in July of 1953 in the Chorwon-Kumhwa sector.  Here engineers often confronted enemy patrols and heavy mortar, artillery, and sniper fire.  Toward the close of the war, Company D worked as engineers during the day and served as blocking infantry at night at the position known as the Hook.  During the American Revolution, George Washington appointed the first engineer officers, and engineers have served in combat in all the wars to follow.  The 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion identifies as its parent unit the Battalion of Engineers, initially organized on August 3, 1861.  Prior to the Korean War, the 2nd Engineers and its lineage had been awarded campaign streamers from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II.  In the Korean War, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion protected the retreating Eighth Army and 2nd Infantry Division at Kunu-ri when U.S. and U.N. troops were surprised and overrun by the Chinese in late fall of 1950.  As a result of a missed communication, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was left as the last unit in opposition to the Chinese onslaught and was decimated on November 30, 1950.
628. Brock is pictured in the foreground of the image with a jeep and tents pictured in the background at this unknown location.  This area would be a staging site for one of the engineer projects that Brock and his squad were sent to undertake.
629. At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away. Brock served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War. He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division Second to None. His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea's Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips. They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee. In June of 1966, they were blessed with twin daughters, Darla and Karla. Brock is a longtime faithful member of the Findlay United Methodist Church. After thirty-five years of devoted service, he retired from Mallory Controls in Sparta.
630. Brock is pictured in casual dress as he is photographed at Sparta's Johnson Photography Studio. This would be in 1951 after he returned from a month-long visit with his brother James and his family in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. James Edward Brock, David Franklin's older brother, was born in 1926, and he served in the Army during World War II.
631. A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home. Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised. Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952. The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room. Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman. The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed. The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping. Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well. Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen. With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70% of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II's percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans. These children garnered the label "dust of the street," having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger. American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.
632. The soldier stands on top of one of the building's ventilators. To his right are the chimney pipes that come out from under the orphanage. The orphanage was built with regular concrete floors, but many homes in Korea at this time had dirt floors. In both cases, to supply heat to the structure, tunnels were dug under the floor (sometimes lined with metal piping that might have been fashioned from melted shell casings). A fire would be lit with pine needles inside the building, and the heat generated would be spread by the ventilators across the structure through the tunnels under the floor. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
633. Brock is pictured in the gardens of his Tokyo Civil Service Hotel while on leave. He stands on a structure located at the back of the hotel built to resemble a boat.
634. At the age of twenty, David Franklin Brock, a farm boy from Van Buren County, had only been out of the state of Tennessee once in his life before his country called him a world away.  Brock served from January of 1952 to October of 1953 in the Korean War.  He trained at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  He attained the rank of corporal as a combat engineer with the Second Infantry Division, the famed Indianhead Division—“Second to None.” His unit built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire.  As a demolitions specialist, he detonated explosives and laid and cleared mines.  As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier.  During his tour of duty, he was stationed in Korea’s Chorwon Valley, Kumhwa region, and at the Hook. Brock came home on active reserve to his sweetheart, Laura Mae Phillips.  They married in 1954 and made their home in Sparta, Tennessee.  In June of 1966, they were blessed with twin daughters, Darla and Karla. Brock is a longtime faithful member of the Findlay United Methodist Church.  After thirty-five years of devoted service, he retired from Mallory Controls in Sparta.
635. Black lacquer cover that housed the second David Franklin Brock Korean War photograph album displays a map of Japan featuring major cities. The outline of Japan is flanked by typical images associated with the country, such as a rickshaw and a tea house or pagoda. Brock obtained this album at the port city of Yokohama, where American soldiers spent a week being oriented and equipped before sailing for Korea. The soldiers were not allowed off the base, but this military installation had an attached shopping facility staffed by Japanese civilians paid to man the stores. Soldiers were instructed not to tip these workers. The stores contained both common and fine items, like silver. Japanese citizens were also hired to package soldiers' purchases and ship the items back to America. Brock purchased multiple photo albums and had them shipped home to his mother in Van Buren County. He believes that he assembled this second album for his mother after he married and presented it to her. Likely, near the time of her death, she gave it back to him.
636. This unidentified private sitting atop an Army jeep was a member of Brock's squad. Brock remembers that this soldier was from the North and believes he was probably a replacement for one of the original squad members. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
637. Brock appears with three other members of his squad (same tent & same missions). Brock can identifiy Robbie, the African American jeep driver from Wisconsin sitting at the front. The other two soldiers Brock cannot identify. He believes that both of these men were from the North and were replacements for original squad members. A jeep appears parked in front of the 2nd Division Friendship Home in the background of this photo. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They stayed in a tent set up in a grown-up area near the orphanage and a civilian population. Squad members had to take turns pulling guard duty to insure their tent was secure. This squad from Company D of the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion insulated the overhead of the orphanage where the ceiling had been sweating.
638. Brock's fellow engineer Martinez, who grew up on a farm in Michigan, is pictured on break, leaning against a road bank. He is a Company D soldier, but not in Brock's squad. He has no helmet, so he is in a relatively safe area in the Kumhwa region.
639. A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home. Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised. Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952. The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room. Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home. The 2nd Division Friendship Home was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1952, and staffed by a Korean doctor-dentist, a teacher, two cooks, and a handyman. The fund also provided for clothing, building improvements, and toys to be purchased from Japan to assist the eighty-two Kapyong orphans, ranging in age from two to fifteen years, the orphanage initially housed. The donation fund was ongoing to support the upkeep of the facility and future projects such as a playground and landscaping. Second Division soldiers gifted the orphans with candy washcloths, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and soap, and they encouraged and funneled donations from the United States to the home, as well. Over four hundred orphanages in Korea were built or repaired by U.S. servicemen. With an estimated civilian casualty rate of nearly 70% of total casualties, (In contrast, World War II's percentage was estimated at forty.) the Korean War is thought to have generated 100,000 war orphans. These children garnered the label dust of the street, having lost parents to wartime separation, bombs and bullets, disease, or hunger. American churches and civic organizations such as the Rotary Club and the American Legion rendered humanitarian aid to Korean orphans. The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.
640. Brock and an unidentified replacement squad member stand on both sides of the 2nd Division Indianhead emblem positioned in front of the division-supported orphanage, known as the 2nd Division Friendship Home. The support and encompassing structure of the emblem stand were fashioned entirely from concrete. The emblem added on top is thought to be metal, with color present to convey the unique Indianhead design.
641. Brock cannot identify these squad members; he believes them to be replacements. There is a private sitting to Brock's right, and a corporal is sitting to Brock's left. A jeep appears parked in front of the 2nd Division Friendship Home in the background of this photo. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
642. Brock is posing with his  .45 pistol on a boulder in the Kumhwa region following a hard day's work. The engineers were doing intensive road work in this solitary area. The terrain was quite rough, and Brock recalls that every hill that was mounted only allowed a view of perhaps a mile or two before vision was blocked by yet a higher hill.
643. Foreground of the image conveys the terrain surrounding the 2nd Division Friendship Home complex. One Korean orphanage staff member appears in the middleground of the photo. Koreans were largely responsible for the running of the institution. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
644. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
645. Debris in this image might be sleeping mats removed from the orphanage after being ruined by the dripping ceiling. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
646. Brock captured this image of soldiers, staff, and orphans gathered around as the 2nd Division makes a regular supply delivery to the institution they support. Pulled up to the entrance is an Army jeep with a trailer behind. The orphanage was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
647. Hailing from Montgomery, Maryland and being a member of the 1951 Class of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Louis John Storck headed to Fort Belvoir, Virginia for engineer training. First Lieutenant Storck then made his way to Korea and the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion. The Army initially assigned Storck to Company D, but he was transferred to Company B to fill a leadership vacancy shortly after David Franklin Brock arrived. Storck made a deep impression on Brock, however. Brock remembers the Lieutenant as being a fine man and a highly respected officer. On October 6, 1952, Storck and three of his men were ordered to clear mines on the road to Mundung-ni, North Korea in the vicinity of Pangsok-tong. The soldiers operated under heavy enemy mortar and artillery fire around the outposts in front of Hill 281 throughout the course of the day. The outpost that had been occupied by French troops came under enemy attack at dusk, and Storck and his men bravely decided to remain and try to defend it. They repulsed an initial attempt to cut them off from the main line of resistance (MLR), having to resort to hand to hand combat. Night found their position overrun, and the soldiers cut off from the MLR. Though Storck and his men were wounded, under his leadership they attempted to cross into friendly lines. The four men crossed paths with the enemy, and the Lieutenant was mortally wounded. Storck's gallantry in action was recognized with the Silver Star. The pictured bridge built by Storck and his men as combat engineers was named in his honor.
648. Two of Brock's fellow combat engineers are pictured at the front of one of their trucks at the site of the Storck Memorial Bridge. Brock believes that he and his combat engineer squad must have been passing through the area on an engineer mission around the time of the sign being erected and the dedication ceremony. They then stopped to take some pictures and pay their respects. Brock remembers the white private to be a Northerner, and the African American soldier to be from the South. Both were likely replacements. Lettering on the front of the truck indicates 2nd Infantry Division, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D. This truck had no top. There were seats present in the back to haul men, but material could be hauled as well. The circular apparatus atop the truck could function as a rotating mount for a .50 caliber machine gun. At the front base of the truck are located hooks and a wench. A couple of soldiers are also pictured at the back of the truck
649. A meeting between the mayor of Kapyong province and 2nd Division Commander General James C. Fry in June of 1952 spawned the idea of building a division-sponsored orphanage, the 2nd Division Friendship Home.  Soldiers of the division contributed monthly to a fund, and within five months, nearly $38,000 was raised.  Korean contractors at the Chongpyong-ni site began construction on the 24-bedroom facility on September 20, 1952.  The orphanage featured a recreation hall/study, dining hall, kitchen, bathrooms, washroom, employee living quarters, and storage room.  Four officers and five enlisted men comprised the board of governors for the home.

The adoption of Korean War orphans by American families comprised the first mass wave of international, interracial adoptions and paved the way for those instances that followed.
650. Brock records the Korean countryside surrounding the orphanage. This is a civilized, safe area. In this image, the most distinct, cultivated rows on flat ground are rice paddies. The terrain must be flat for the water to remain on the crop. The surrounding rows on the hilly, uneven earth might be beets, radishes, or the like. The Koreans made use of every bit of land they could for farming. They generally used wooden plows with wooden teeth pulled by water buffalo. Healthy trees and a farm shed are also present in this image.
651. A Christmas tree with a cross on top and attached lights is pictured outside of a church or chapel. This is a cut tree; a stand can be seen. There is a church-shaped sign with "chapel" written on it that conveys worship times by denomination.
652. Brock in front of the 2nd Division Orphanage--referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home. It was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. Brock is pictured with the 2nd Division emblem. The support and encompassing structure of the emblem stand were fashioned entirely from concrete. The emblem added on top is thought to be metal, with color present to convey the unique Indianhead design. The Division sponsored and supported the orphanage. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
653. Brock believes that he and his combat engineer squad must have been passing through the area on an engineer mission around the time of the sign being erected and the dedication ceremony. They then stopped to take some pictures and pay their respects.
654. The 2nd Division Orphanage, referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home, was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it.

The support and encompassing structure of the emblem stand were fashioned entirely from concrete. The emblem added on top is thought to be metal, with color present to convey the unique Indianhead design. A Korean guard is seen posted at the door of the orphanage.
655. This is a safe civilian population likely near the 2nd Division Orphanage. This village would not be located within twenty miles of the front. A Korean civilian male appears in the foreground of the image.
656. The 2nd Division Orphanage, also referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home, was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
657. Three soldiers work to get memorial sign in place prior to bridge dedication. Sign can be seen lying flat in the foreground of the image. Four additional soldiers are working at the other end of the bridge. The bridge from this angle appears to be composed entirely of wood, with huge lengths of wood running vertically across the top. Brock believes that he and his combat engineer squad must have been passing through the area on an engineer mission around the time of the sign being erected and the dedication ceremony. They then stopped to take some pictures and pay their respects.
658. Corner image of the chapel with church-shaped sign for services clearly in view. Protestant and Catholic denominations are listed with their services expressed in military hours. The sign proclaims "Everyone Welcome." The 2nd Division Orphanage, also referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home, was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
659. Martinez, a soldier from Michigan, is pictured with a bayonet in his grasp. The 2nd Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D was doing intensive road work in this solitary area of Kumhwa. The terrain was quite rough, and Brock recalls that every hill that was mounted only allowed a view of perhaps a mile or two before vision was blocked by yet another higher hill.
660. After spending long months at the Korean War front, Brock is pictured treating himself to a bath in his Tokyo hotel room while on R&R.
661. While in the field, Army soldiers such as Brock only received a chance for a shower about every two weeks. A group would be taken in an open truck to a shower location at least ten miles from the front. At that point, soldiers left all their dirty clothing with South Koreans who operated the showers and laundry and received clean uniforms of a comparable size that had been left previously by other units. In the interim and depending upon the weather, soldiers would either wash-up in their tents using their helmets to hold water, or utilize an outdoor washstand and basin. Such military fumigation and bath operations were generally set up alongside a body of water and equipped with pumps, boilers, washing machines, and portable showers. Their mission was to support combat troops by offering hot showers and clean clothing. Brock's experience of Rest and Recuperation (R&R) was shared by more than 800,000 American soldiers in the Korean War. Inaugurated in early 1951, this morale-boosting military program allowed American soldiers and marines to earn five days of leave in a Japanese city for every 180 days of active duty, regardless of rank. The genesis of this program lay in World War II studies that indicated casualty rates increase dramatically past 180 consecutive days of combat service. Three processing centers (Tokyo, Osaka, and Kokura) received military personnel arriving by air and sea, and generally supplied them with dress uniforms, pay, and accommodations. R&R official quarters might be on military bases, at military Special Services hotels, or at Civil Service hotels that prioritized the military. Unofficially, however, soldiers might seek out private Japanese inns and hotels. American soldiers interacted with the Japanese in bars, clubs, hotels, and in the streets of cities like Tokyo. R&R experiences allowed for not only a respite from the stresses of war, but also helped cement American post-World War II reconciliation with the Japanese people.
662. Soldier seen sweeping the roped-off bridge in preparation for the dedication. Propped against the bridge are soldiers' M-1 rifles and coats. In the background at the other end of the bridge, a military truck is parked, and a jeep is driving away from the bridge. Brock believes that he and his combat engineer squad must have been passing through the area on an engineer mission around the time of the sign being erected and the dedication ceremony. They then stopped to take some pictures and pay their respects.
663. Entrance to the 2nd Division orphanage features sign stating "Friendship Home; A Refuge for Child Victims of Communist Aggression; Assisted by Contributions and Material Support from Soldiers of the 2D Infantry Div., U.S. Army." The sign sports the 2nd Division Indianhead emblem that is also shown at the front of the orphanage building. Two individuals stand in the foreground of the image. The 2nd Division Orphanage, also referred to as the 2nd Infantry Division Friendship Home, was built in June of 1952 at Chong P'yong-Ni by Korean carpenters. The Division sponsored and supported it. Brock's squad was transported by truck to work at the home. They insulated the overhead where the ceiling had been sweating.
664. Exterior shot of Phillips holding two bunches of freshly gathered wild honeysuckle at the Brock family farm in Van Buren County. David Franklin Brock would have taken this photograph while on leave from his engineer training at Fort Leonard Wood.
665. Dog Company combat engineers Brock and Connors are pictured relaxing at a location near their Tokyo Civil Service Hotel while on R&R. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He spent it in Tokyo with fellow squad member Connors. Brock was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.
666. One of the hotel's female gardeners appears in the background of the image. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He spent it in Tokyo with fellow squad member Connors. Brock was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.
667. Brock and a young boy are positioned in front of a boat garden structure in the park-like confines behind the Tokyo Civil Service Hotel. Brock and Connors only ventured into the city once while on leave in Tokyo. They stayed in or near their hotel, for the most part. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He spent it in Tokyo with fellow squad member Connors. Brock was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.

Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.
669. Brock posing in front of a chesnut orchard in Kumhwa. This was during a time period when the engineers were heavily involved in road building. Engineer equipment is pictured behind Brock--trucks and trailers. Two lines of laundry also appear in the image, as squad tents are close at hand. Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
670. Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&R. Military personnel walk around a cluster of miitary jeeps and trucks. Pictured is a C-124 Globemaster four-engine plane. Tanks could be driven into the open front of the plane; it was three-decks high inside the cargo hold. Brock flew in the same type of plane to Tokyo and back. The plane was 40,000 lbs. overweight and had mechanical trouble with an engine when taking off from Korea; the exact same plane carried Brock back to Korea from Japan following his R&R. Another smaller plane is visible in the background of this photo.
671. Military personnel are pictured sitting and reclining in the airport apron waiting area of the Korean air base. Locations for the gathering of specific personnel are designated by "packet" signs. A number of aircraft can be seen on the airport runway in the background of the shot. This is the Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&R. The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.
672. Locations for the gathering of specific personnel are designated by "packet" signs. Several airplanes can be seen on the airport runway in the background of the shot. This is the Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&R. The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.
673. Military personnel wait on benches with bags and bedrolls. Locations for the gathering of specific personnel are designated by "packet" signs. Several airplanes, an ambulance, a bus, and a tower can be seen in the background of the shot. This is the Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&R. The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.
674. Soldiers are seen on a bench in the waiting area of the airport apron. One soldier reads a newspaper, while another lies on the bench with his head completely covered. Locations for the gathering of specific personnel are designated by "packet" signs. Several airplanes appear in the background of the image. This is the Korean military air base where Brock and Connors left and returned to Korea with their Tokyo R&R. The United Nations Far East Air Force used fifteen air bases in Japan for combat support over the course of the war, and built or improved fifty-five airfields in Korea.
675. Brock and Connors would have received dress uniforms and pay when they arrived at the Tokyo R&R processing center. This image features the military scrip that they received as pay and two glasses on the table that held port wine. While in Korea, Brock had asked his Aunt Molly to mail him a billfold that zipped all the way around. When the billfold arrived, it contained an American one dollar bill. Brock kept that bill with him (the only American currency that he possessed) the whole time that he was in Korea, and he brought it back to the United States at the end of his military service.
676. Each of the men pictured were not only in Brock's company, but also in his squad (same tent & same missions). In a typical base camp, such as this station at Kumhwa, each squad would be in a tent with eight to ten cots. This image reflects the diversity present in the 2nd Infantry Division. 2nd Infantry Division units saw black, white, and South Korean KATUSA soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. Identications include (back row from left to right) North Korean spy Kim; John Perdedas; Robert L. Borders; unidentified; Coots; (front row from left to right) Le Bon Duc; unidentified; Austin; Cook from Illinois. This was during a time period when the engineers were heavily involved in road building. Engineer equipment is pictured behind the soldiers--trucks and trailers. Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
677. Soldier Coots is standing at the far left of the image. Coots was from the vicinity of Harlan, Kentucky. He was illiterate, and Brock read Coots his wife's letters and wrote her back. Soldier Cook from Illinois is positioned at the far right and is playing a harmonica. This was during a time period when the engineers were heavily involved in road building. Engineer equipment is pictured behind the soldiers--trucks and trailers. Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
678. While taking a break from road work, Brock and his South Korean fellow squad member (same tent & same mission) Le Bon Duc engage in horseplay.
679. Combat engineer Robert L. Borders of Brock's squad is pictured. In a typical base camp, such as this station at Kumhwa, each squad would be in a tent with eight to ten cots. The squad shared not only a tent but the same missions. This was Brock's squad tent, as well. 2nd Infantry Division units saw black, white, and South Korean KATUSA soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together. Also pictured are the mess kits of squad members hanging to dry in the sun. Outside the mess hall would be located large galvanized cans with oil heaters in the bottom to boil the water contained within. When soldiers finished eating, they would wash their mess kits in one can, rinse them in the other, and take them back to their tents to hang them up. Also in view are a machine gun and rocket launcher. The squad's weapons were left like this in front of the tent, so they could grab them easily and be taken in at night. Each soldier had an assigned weapon. Brock's was this rocket launcher.
680. This out-of-focus image reflects the area at Brock's Kumhwa base camp where the kitchen, the cooks, and the company commander were located.
681. This out-of-focus image reflects the area a mile or two up the valley from Brock's Kumhwa base camp where a medical outfit is located. Brock visited there once for a stomach ailment.
682. The lake and gardens of this R&R hotel were located at the back of the facility. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He spent it in Tokyo with fellow squad member Connors. Brock was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly.

Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
696. As a soldier in the 2nd Infantry Division's 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, Company D attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion, David Franklin Brock built roads, bridges, and bunkers for the front while often under enemy fire. Brock, a demolitions specialist, detonated explosives and laid and cleared land mines. As with all combat engineers, he was trained in combat infantry, and, when needed, functioned as an infantry soldier. The summer of 1952 found Dog Company on the line west of Chorwon repairing heavy monsoon damage to roads and bridges, mass producing prefabricated log bunkers for the 2nd Division through Operation Abe Lincoln, and designing a new mobile attack bunker for the infantry that could be quickly assembled for overhead cover and protection. The 2nd Engineers also laid minefields, tactical wire, napalm and booby traps, often under mortar and artillery fire, to strengthen the hill outposts of Old Baldy, T-Bone, and Arrowhead Ridge. Attention was then turned to improving supply routes and shelter and installation construction for the winter. After coming out of reserve in late January of 1953, the 2nd Engineers supported infantry regiments in battle positions in the British Commonwealth section. D Company maintained the main supply routes to the front, in general support of the division, and continued to build bunkers for the 2nd Infantry Division. Another stint in reserve was followed by more support of the 2nd Division by the battalion beginning in July of 1953 in the Chorwon-Kumhwa sector. Here engineers often confronted enemy patrols and heavy mortar, artillery, and sniper fire. Toward the close of the war, Company D worked as engineers during the day and served as blocking infantry at night at the position known as The Hook. During the American Revolution, George Washington appointed the first engineer officers, and engineers have served in combat in all the wars to follow. The 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion identifies as its parent unit the Battalion of Engineers, initially organized on August 3, 1861. Prior to the Korean War, the 2nd Engineers and its lineage had been awarded campaign streamers from the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War I, and World War II. In the Korean War, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion protected the retreating Eighth Army and 2nd Infantry Division at Kunu-Ri when U.S. and U.N. troops were surprised and overrun by the Chinese in late fall of 1950. As a result of a missed communication, the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion was left as the last unit in opposition to the Chinese onslaught and was decimated on November 30, 1950.
697. Brock's fellow engineer Martinez, who grew up on a farm in Michigan, is pictured standing in the middle of a road. Martinez is aiming his .45 pistol toward the camera. He is a Company D soldier, but not in Brock's squad. He has no helmet, so he is in a relatively safe area in the Kumhwa region.
698. Robert L. Borders is standing with an unidentified African American soldier in front of Borders's squad tent. In a typical base camp, such as this station at Kumhwa, each squad would be in a tent with eight to ten cots. The squad shared not only a tent, but the same missions. This was Brock's squad tent, as well. 2nd Infantry Division units saw black, white, and South Korean KATUSA soldiers sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing together.
699. Brock is writing a letter while on leave in his hotel room at the Civil Service Hotel in Tokyo. He is dressed in his OD's (olive drab uniform), minus the jacket and cap. Brock had only this one-week leave during his tour of duty in Korea. He was close to being due another, when it was time for him to go home, but he didn't want to take it; the plane trouble during this leave made safety a consideration. Also, he wanted to get home more quickly. Brock's girlfriend, whom he would later marry, Laura Mae Phillips, has written across the photograph "Writing Laura."
700. Brock, pictured in his overalls with a pencil sticking out his pocket, displays a slight smile for the photographer. He is attending either first or second grade at Cummingsville School. He got a late start, recalling that he initially reported for what was supposed to be his first year of school, returned home the first day telling his family someone had pinched him, and refused to go back until the following year.
701. Brock strikes a pose in front of a chestnut orchard at the the Kumhwa base camp. This is the only image of Brock with a scarf tucked inside the collar of his uniform. During this time period, the engineers were heavily involved in road building. Brock's company was attached to the 72nd Tank Battalion. If that battalion went into battle, Brock's unit would go with them.
702. John L. Sales of Nashville, Tenn. (b. April 7, 1947) served in the United States Marine Corps from May 1966 to May 1968. A member of Co. A, 1st Battalion, 4th Rgt., 3rd Marine Division, he saw action in the northern sector of South Vietnam from December 1966 to June 1967. Wounded twice in combat, Pvt. Sales received the Purple Heart medal.
703. Photographs from four different angles of Purple Heart medal awarded to John Sales for wounds sustained during his service in Vietnam. Sales was wounded twice in Vietnam--once in February 1967 by a sniper as he was crossing a rice paddy; secondly, in an April 10 night ambush by Viet Cong as his patrol was encamped along a trail.
704. Photographs of the Armed Forces Expeditionary and the National Defense Service medals awarded to John Sales for military service in Vietnam.
705. With a magic marker, Sales drew this graffiti on the canvas bunk above his own. It includes Nashville-based radio station call letters, girlfriends' names, local schools, cars, and places in Vietnam where he'd been.
706. Letter written on April 8, 1967 from South Vietnam, mostly asking for news of family and friends and supplies such as film. Sales speaks of receiving the new M-16 rifle which replaced the M-14 infantrymen previously used.
707. Letter written on August 25, 1966 from Camp Gieger near the Marine base at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where Sales went for advanced training. Sales is preparing to come home for 30-day leave before shipping out to Camp Pendleton and on to Vietnam. He asks his mother to make sure his car is ready and to prepare some of his favorite dishes.
708. Letter written on February 13, 1967 from on board the USS Iwo Jima.On the eve of a big airborne assault, Sales informs his mother that his unit--Co. A, 1st Battalion, 4th Marine Rgt., 3rd Marine Div.--is about to ""helicopter into V[iet] C[ong] territory"" as part of operation ""Deckhouse 6.""
709. Undated letter written on Marine stationary, probably  from boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, ""Junior"" writes that he is three weeks from graduation, which would put it in June-July 1966. On reverse side Sales has written reminders to himself of proper naval protocol, how to address officers, board ships, salute, etc.
710. Undated letter written on Marine stationary, probably  from boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina, ""Junior"" writes that he is graduating on July 19 [1966] and that ""this is the hardest training in the world."" He tells his mother that there is no time to get in trouble since they are busy from 5am to 8pm. Parris Island was surrounded by swamps, and Sales relates how a boy tried unsuccessfully to escape through the swamp.

720. Sales with unidentified fellow Marine in the bunk area of the troopship General Nelson M. Walker on his way home in December 1967; these are the canvas bunks on the bottom of which Sales and other troop passengers left graffiti.
721. Letter written on February 15, 1967, "Junior" tells his mother that the big airborne operation was cancelled because of weather and cloud cover that would have grounded the Marines' air support, a crucial element in many American ground operations in Vietnam.
722. Sales came home from Vietnam on the troopship General Nelson M. Walker in December 1967. This is the homecoming or welcoming committee that was there on the dock at San Diego to meet them--Marine band, group of female Marines, and MPs (military police).
723. Sales came home from Vietnam on the troopship General Nelson M. Walker in December 1967. Returnees were cautioned to throw any contraband brought from Vietnam overboard before docking at San Diego.

732. In 1826, Secretary of War James Barbour appointed John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds as commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. Their orders included the complete cession of their lands east of the Mississippi River. They ultimately failed to convince the nations to acquiesce to their demand in 1826. However, in 1830 and 1832 the Choctaw and Chickasaw, respectively, signed the Treaty of Pontotoc ceding the remainder of their eastern tribal lands to the United States. George Strother Gaines, the brother of Edmund Pendleton Gaines, served as assistant Indian factor for the Choctaw, negotiated the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, and led an expedition to survey the Choctaw lands in Indian Territory.
733. Regarding upcoming negotiations with the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations for the cession of territory, Gaines wrote to the three treaty commissioners at the request of the War Department to inform them of "the feelings of the Chactaw [sic] Indians on the subject of a cession of their lands." Gaines had recently attended a council meeting near the Choctaw agency in which not one was in favor of selling their lands. He told them of a recent change of chiefs in the northern and western districts of the nation, but was not sure how that would affect their proceedings. He reported that the council adopted a constitution and that the prospect of an exchange of lands was "very gloomy." Gaines estimated that the middle of October would be the best time to negotiate a treaty.  He discussed meeting with the Chickasaw as well and mentioned that Jesse Brashears would be a good person to include in those negotiations.
734. Muster roll of friendly Creek troops raised during the First Seminole War. It listed the names, ranks, expiration of service, and remarks for the 68 Creek warriors under the command of Captain Powas Hanjo. The remarks sections indicated that Jackson had allowed four days for them to return home. They were being mustered out for discharge according to Major George Cutler. Since the 1818 Florida incursion was a US regular army operation, these native allies were likely being paid by the Federal government. Jackson as a military commander used Native American allies in nearly all of his military operations.
735. Coffee wrote his wife, Mary,  just weeks after the Battle of New Orleans to recount both the night engagement and full battle. He began with a description of the night battle of December 23, 1814.  Coffee led 600 regulars and 200 militia, by moonlight, to engage the British, camped "within six miles of New Orleans." After explaining the course of the battle, he estimates the losses on both sides as 25 killed, 70 wounded, and 75 captured for the Americans, and 400 killed and wounded, with 100 taken prisoner for the British. Though there were only two large scale engagements, the two sides continuously harried each other with bombardments and small arms fire; Coffee remarked that it felt like "one continuous battle for twenty eight days." He went into detail about the January 8 battle [the one referred to as the Battle of New Orleans], telling his wife "they lost in killed wounded and prisoners upwards of three thousand men, their commander in chief, and second in command, both killed, and Major General Kean badly wounded." After the battle the British decamped and left the area on January 18, 1815. Coffee estimates "our whole loss in all this affair has been about fifty killed, one hundred and twenty wounded, and one hundred and ten prisoners, all of which we have since got by exchange." Coffee concludes the letter with personal expressions to his wife and daughter, and an update regarding a Mr. Harris who reached New Orleans from Mobile the day before.
736. The primary Battle of New Orleans took place on January 8, 1815, the culmination of 17 days of engagement between American and British troops south of New Orleans. Under cover of artillery fire, the British launched a two-pronged attack on the American breastworks at the Rodriquez Canal on the morning of January 8. One, led by Colonel William Thornton on the west bank of the Mississippi River, attempted to distract from the main assault, but a collapsed dam and heavy mud, held it up. The main force, led by Major General Samuel Gibbs, marched toward the center of the fortifications, held by Major General William Carroll, hidden by a dense fog. As they neared the defenses, the fog lifted exposing them to heavy artillery fire, which, along with forgetting to bring the ladders and fascines to cross the canal, decimated the British advance. Major General John Keane led a small detachment to assist the assault but was wounded while crossing the battlefield. Colonel Rennie and most other senior officers, as well as a large number of their troops, were killed in the initial attack. Major General Edward Pakenham, the commander of the entire British force, led a second wave, which collapsed when both Pakenham and Gibbs received fatal wounds by grapeshot. Major Wilkinson led a third and final assault on the breastworks, but was wounded when he made it to the American line. The remainder of the British force, primarily reserves commanded by Major General John Lambert, retreated toward camp. Thornton's delayed attack on the west bank was initially successful, but the lack of support left these achievements unrealized. Adjutant General Robert Butler reported to Jackson that the British sustained 700 killed, 1400 wounded, and 500 taken prisoner; however, the United States Army Center for Military History today states 285 killed, 1,265 wounded, and 484 captured or missing. The American suffered only 13 dead, 30 wounded, and 19 captured or missing. This one-sided victory cemented Andrew Jackson's reputation as a war hero and thrust him into the national spotlight.
737. A two page letter dated April 1, 1814, and sent from Fort Williams in Alabama. Coffee described a victorious battle fought against the Creek Indians at the bend of the "Tallepoosey" [Tallapoosa] River. He mentioned taking 700 mounted men and 600 Indians across the river to prevent an escape. Coffee remarked that they "put the whole to death but a few that hid under the banks of the river." He estimated the enemy's losses to be about 850 to 900 dead, and 500 captured.  His casualty numbers for "friendly Indians" differed from Jackson's, stating that 26 white men were killed and 106 wounded, while 23 "friendly Indians" were killed and 47 wounded. He hoped to see an end to the Creek War within 10 days' time. A postscript related the news of Major Lemuel Montgomery's death in the battle.
738. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend was fought on March 27, 1814, between the war faction (Red Stick) Creek and a coalition of American and Native American troops. The decisive battle proved to be the climax of the Creek War, a conflict between warring factions of Creek and their allies as a part of the War of 1812. Major General Andrew Jackson led a force of just over 2,700 soldiers composed of US Regulars, Tennessee militia and volunteers, as well as 500 Cherokee and 100 allied Creek warriors to a Red Stick fortification at a bend on the Tallapoosa River in present-day Alabama. Jackson estimated that the defending Red Sticks numbered about a thousand. Jackson sent General John Coffee, the cavalry, and almost all of their Indian allies to encircle the encampment and prevent any escape. A two hour artillery barrage preceded a covert attack on the fortification led by Captain Russell, Colonel Richard Brown [Cherokee], and Colonel Morgan, who was in overall command of the Cherokee. This small force set fire to a few of the buildings in an attempt to force the Red Sticks out. The 39th US Infantry, raised almost exclusively in Tennessee and led by Colonel John Williams and Major Lemuel Montgomery, mounted a simultaneous frontal assault of the fortification.  Third lieutenant Sam Houston participated in this assault and was wounded, while Montgomery was killed. In his official report, Jackson recorded, "The enemy, altho[ugh] many of them fought to the last with that kind of bravery which desperation inspires, were at length entirely routed and cut to pieces." Many escaping Red Sticks were killed by Coffee's troops. Jackson estimated 800 enemy were killed, including their prophet, Monahee, who was shot in the mouth. Jackson commented, "as if heaven designed to chastise his impostures by an appropriate punishment." He reported that 26 white men were killed along with 18 Cherokee, with 107 and 36 wounded, respectively.
739. A four-page letter written from Florence, Alabama, on April 25, 1828. Coffee answers Sam Houston's inquiry regarding the accusation (no doubt connected with the 1828 presidential election) that the Battle of Horseshoe Bend was a "cold blooded massacre." Coffee defends General Andrew Jackson's conduct there and throughout the war. He states that "It was most certainly [Jackson's] object and his orders to kill in battle as many of the enemy as possible, but I never know him to treat a prisoner with cruelty or inhumanity." Coffee continues, "on the contrary, I have seen him uniformly...take them into safe keeping and have them guarded and protected from his friendly Indians...who would put them to torture and to death." He explains that Jackson ordered an end to the pursuit of escapees after the battle and had interpreters offer them terms, but the enemy fired upon them  Coffee mentions "Lincoyer" the infant Creek whom Jackson later adopted, and he states that the child's mother had been unavoidably killed at Tallushatchee.
740. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend was fought on March 27, 1814, between the war faction (Red Stick) Creek and a coalition of American and Native American troops. The decisive battle proved to be the climax of the Creek War, a conflict between warring factions of Creek and their allies as a part of the War of 1812. Major General Andrew Jackson led a force of just over 2,700 soldiers composed of US Regulars, Tennessee militia and volunteers, as well as 500 Cherokee and 100 allied Creek warriors to a Red Stick fortification at a bend on the Tallapoosa River in present-day Alabama. Jackson estimated that the defending Red Sticks numbered about a thousand. Jackson sent General John Coffee, the cavalry, and almost all of their Indian allies to encircle the encampment and prevent any escape. A two hour artillery barrage preceded a covert attack on the fortification led by Captain Russell, Colonel Richard Brown [Cherokee], and Colonel Morgan, who was in overall command of the Cherokee. This small force set fire to a few of the buildings in an attempt to force the Red Sticks out. The 39th US Infantry, raised almost exclusively in Tennessee and led by Colonel John Williams and Major Lemuel Montgomery, mounted a simultaneous frontal assault of the fortification.  Third lieutenant Sam Houston participated in this assault and was wounded, while Montgomery was killed. In his official report, Jackson recorded, "The enemy, altho[ugh] many of them fought to the last with that kind of bravery which desperation inspires, were at length entirely routed and cut to pieces." Many escaping Red Sticks were killed by Coffee's troops. Jackson estimated 800 enemy were killed, including their prophet, Monahee, who was shot in the mouth. Jackson commented, "as if heaven designed to chastise his impostures by an appropriate punishment." He reported that 26 white men were killed along with 18 Cherokee, with 107 and 36 wounded, respectively. David Crockett, in his autobiography, recounted of the Battle of Tallushatchee that they "shot them like dogs," "set the house on fire, and burned it up with the forty-six warriors in it."
741. This night battle of December 23 served as a precursor to the greater battle on January 8. On the morning of the 23rd, British General John Keane and 1,800 regulars landed south of New Orleans. Andrew Jackson led a detachment of over 2,000 men to meet them seven miles south of the city. He surprised them in the night and the almost two-and-a-half hour battle delayed further British advance until January. This allowed the Americans to construct earthworks to protect their artillery, until the main attack occurred on January 8, 1815.
742. Three-page letter from General William Carroll to General James Winchester describing the December 23, 1814, night battle at New Orleans against the British. Carroll reported that the British disembarked from their ships on December 23 and Jackson led several corps to meet them "about seven miles below the city of New Orleans and gave him battle in the night and drove him off his ground." According to Carroll the battle lasted about two hours and twenty minutes. After the skirmish, Jackson "erected a fortified camp four miles below the city," and had "been fighting the enemy every day since the battle." He described the British bombardment of their fortifications as a, "tremendous firing of cannon balls, bomb shells, and Congreve rockets." He estimated the enemy to be about seven or eight thousand strong.
743. Regarding their prospective duel, Gov. Sevier responded to Jackson's letter from earlier in the day, October 10. He began by saying, "I am again perplexed with your scurilous [sic] and poltroon language." He chastised Jackson for requesting a meeting within the state, knowing full well that as governor he cannot violate state law by doing so. He stated that Jackson's "conduct during the whole of [his] pretended bravery, shows [him] to be a pitiful poltroon and coward." Basically accusing Jackson of evading a fight and posturing, Sevier closes by saying: "I shall not receive another letter from you, as I deem you a coward." It appears that Sevier wrote and explanation of the events on the reverse, as it does not appear connected with the correspondence.
744. The bitter feud between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson grew out of a dispute over military appointments with both men competing over a position as major general of the Tennessee militia. The relationship between Sevier and Jackson deteriorated after Jackson accused Sevier of land fraud, asserting that Sevier conspired to destroy original records of land ownership and replace them with forged claims. On October 1, 1803, the two men met on the steps of the Old Knox County Courthouse and traded heated words. Gov. Sevier brandished his sword, dared Jackson to draw arms, then insulted Jackson's wife, Rachel, resulting in a physical confrontation. Jackson lunged at Sevier with his cane, then friends of both parties drew pistols, and shots rang out as a bullet grazed at least one bystander. After allies of both men separated the two, a war of words between the governor and the judge quickly escalated in an exchange of letters. In their correspondence, Jackson requested an 'interview' with Sevier--a commonly understood term for a duel. Dueling, however, was prohibited within the borders of Tennessee, so Sevier offered to meet Jackson at any time and place not within the State of Tennessee. Thereafter the two men argued over the timing and location to settle their dispute. Eventually, Jackson met Sevier near present-day Kingston, Tennessee, where a failed attempt at a duel took place. Loyalists on both sides provided conflicting accounts and details surrounding the chaotic events of that day in sworn affidavits signed by witnesses, and in published newspaper accounts of the incident. Ultimately, tempers cooled, but the animosity between Sevier and Jackson remained until Sevier's death in 1815. (Belt, Gordon T., and Traci Nichols-Belt. John Sevier: Tennessee's First Hero. Charleston: The History Press, 2014.)
745. Regarding their prospective duel, this letter from Jackson to Governor Sevier referred to his previous letter of October 1 and Sevier's letter of October 3. Jackson noted that they were to meet at the Indian boundary line to answer Jackson's satisfaction. He specifically noted "at a place named by me (to remove your squeamish fears)." If Sevier did not meet Jackson, Jackson would "advertise [him] a coward and poltroon." He continued by declaring that Sevier "without provocation, made the attack" and "took the sacred name of a lady on [his] polluted lips." Jackson continued to call Sevier a coward for avoiding a duel and threatened to expose him in the Knoxville Gazette; Sevier can avoid this if he meets Jackson quickly after he receives this letter.
746. Jackson wrote during the Creek War to his friend and quartermaster, William B. Lewis, that they had yet to receive blankets at Fort Strother (Ala.). Jackson states that he was afraid that "before [the blankets] reach me, I shall have no men left to buy or wear them and my corps will be deserted." Jackson reported that he was told that the "Tennessee volunteer infantry" had been "doing there [sic] duty as good soldiers or receiving exemplary punishment for disobedience." He mentioned that that the East Tennessee troops, despite having only been in the field for three months, were all home or marching home except for one regiment. He reports that the militia in his division "caught the disease." Jackson demands that Lewis "arouse the governor from his lethargy" and ask that the militia be drafted into the regular army for six months and "fill the disgraceful retrograde of the volunteers." Jackson hoped to put an end to the Creek War, but could only do so if he had a full complement of troops.
747. William Berkeley Lewis was a longtime friend and associate of Andrew Jackson. He was appointed quartermaster under Jackson during the War of 1812 and assisted Jackson's 1823 campaign for the Senate and presidential campaigns. Once president, Jackson appointed Lewis second auditor of the treasury.
748. Letter from former Tennessee governor Willie Blount to President Andrew Jackson regarding a number of political issues that "contains [his] honest sentiments." Blount began discussing state sovereignty and the Nullification Crisis, decrying the South Carolinians' "noise," "splutters," and "empty declarations." He referred to speeches made by "Stephenson [Andrew Stevenson]," William Cabell Rives, and Daniel Webster that "knock[ed] the doctrine of nullification and secession on the head." He opined that "the Nullifiers of South Carolina will never again run as near the brink of their destruction, as they did..." Blount then moved on to the Force Bill which he described as "the best and most important bill passed at the last session..." Blount believed that the Bill to reduce the Tariff "still need[ed] much alteration and amendment to make it most right..." He then discussed Jackson's administration, comparing it to its predecessors. Blount referred to the policy of Indian removal as "humane and laudable." He expressed a need for "watchfulness and vigilance" regarding western lands. He touched briefly on the Bank Wars but quickly returned to the Nullification Crisis, praising Jackson for "saving the union" against the "boldfaced outrage" of the Southern secessionists.
749. The Nullification Crisis was a confrontation between the federal government and South Carolina over tariffs, South Carolina's perceived rights, and the threat of secession. It began with the passage of the Tariff of 1828, referred to by the South Carolinians as the "Tariff of Abominations." They argued that the tariff protected manufacturing rather than agriculture. Jackson's election as president was expected to ease the tensions, but Jackson refused to lower the tariff until national debts were repaid. After the passage of the Tariff of 1832, Jackson issued the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina denouncing the nullification doctrine. In the following session, the Force Bill was introduced to Congress, which authorized the use of force to ensure that South Carolina would comply with federal tariffs. This led to the introduction of the Compromise Tariff of 1833. The passage of these two bills eased the rising tensions and ultimately ended the crisis.
750. In 1826, Secretary of War James Barbour appointed John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds as commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations. Their orders included the complete cession of their lands east of the Mississippi River. They ultimately failed to convince the nations to acquiesce to their demand in 1826. However, in 1830 and 1832 the Choctaw and Chickasaw, respectively, signed the Treaty of Pontotoc ceding the remainder of their eastern tribal lands to the United States.
751. Letter from James Barbour, Secretary of War, to John Coffee, William Clark, and Thomas Hinds appointing them commissioners to treat with the Choctaw and Chickasaw in order to extinguish their lands within Mississippi. Barbour offered them $20,000 for expenses and expected them to conclude negotiations by October 1, 1826. Barbour authorized them to trade land, "acre for acre" for land in Missouri and Arkansas
752. A two page letter from Mississippian Thomas Hinds to John Coffee regarding treaty negotiations with the Choctaw and Chickasaw. Hinds reported that no negotiations had taken place thus far, but that the two treaties should be held at around the same time. He concluded his letter by suggesting that Jackson might talk with them as the two nations held a "high estimation" of him.
753. Coffee wrote this letter to his wife the day after his first, in case it would reach her more quickly. Again he mentioned the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, reporting that they "killed from eight to nine hundred of the enemy, and took about 500 prisoners- this is the greatest defeat we have ever given them." Coffee claimed that they killed three of their prophets including their "principal one," probably a reference to Monahee. He told her they were heading to the hickory ground and would arrive in "3 or 4 days." He guessed they may have one more battle with the Creeks before they surrender, as they were starving. He expected to be home in about a month. The letter ended with personal remarks and updates about mutual friends.
754. Major General Jackson wrote to James Winchester, commanding at Mobile, concerning supplies. Jackson said that he ordered Captain William Lauderdale to purchase supplies on October 15, and that he heard from him when he arrived at Fort Strother, but not since. Jackson expressed astonishment at Lauderdale's "silence and his failure to execute the business for which he was sent." Jackson rejoiced the victory at New Orleans, giving "sincere thanksgiving for the remarkable interposition of Heaven on our behalf." He laments that a shipment of arms arrived late or "the whole force of [the] invaders might and would have been captured or destroyed." Jackson guessed that the British would not attempt any further attack on the southern coast, specifically Fort Bowyer, but may try to "stir up the Indians" at "Apalachala [Apalachicola]." A postscript stated that their prisoners had just been returned and reported that the British are building flat-bottomed boats.
755. Letter from Pennsylvania congressman James Buchanan to his friend and newspaper editor Hugh Hamilton regarding the 1824 presidential election. Buchanan revealed that William Crawford's supporters wanted to hold a Congressional caucus, and that "all other candidates are opposed to the measure." Buchanan gave his opinion on Jackson as a "mild, frank, and polished" individual. He called him "a real and not a nominal candidate," going so far as to call him the "candidate of Pennsylvania." Buchanan implored his friend not to disrespect Jackson in his publication, and urged him to back Jackson's candidacy. A "strictly confidential" postscript mentioned that a Tennessee legislator planned to oppose the Congressional caucus.
756. The 1824 presidential election was a fierce contest. Four frontrunners, Henry Clay, William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson, were identified as early as a year before the election. The results were highly regional; each candidate won his home state. Jackson received the most popular votes but failed to win a majority of electoral votes so the choice fell to the House of Representatives. Clay threw his support behind Adams, who ultimately won. Adams then appointed Clay as Secretary of State which infuriated Jackson and his supports who deemed it the "corrupt bargain." James Buchanan served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania at the time of this letter and Hugh Hamilton was editor of the Harrisburg Chronicle. Jackson as president later appointed Buchanan as Minister to Russia.
757. Letter from an unidentified "H." to his wife relating the assassination attempt of Richard Lawrence on President Jackson. He states that Lawrence was a "painter by trade and an Englishman by birth." He "believe[s] a special Providence saved the old Hero's life." He describes Jackson's response to the assassination attempt as "gallant"--he was the "coolest man on the ground." He continues with a supposed quote by Jackson once his companions surrounded him, "Stand back gentleman, I shall be stabbed by some unseen hand!" H. tells his wife "it is a great blessing to the country that [Jackson] did not fall."
758. On January 30, 1835, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter, produced two pistols and fired upon Andrew Jackson on the steps of the United States Capitol. Both pistols misfired and an outraged Jackson beat Lawrence with his walking cane. Lawrence was tried for attempted murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity. He was committed to a number of institutions until his death in 1861.
759. In May 1812, Red Stick warriors, possibly adherents of the Shawnee warrior Tecumseh and his brother The Prophet who urged a pan-Indian confederacy to roll back white settlement, attacked the isolated cabins of the Manley and Crawley families on Duck River in Humphreys County. The inhabitants were slain with the exception of Martha Crawley, who was taken captive. Ultimately, Martha Crawley escaped by hiding in a log and returned to Tennessee, but Tennesseans demanded justice for the attack. Friendly Creeks arrested the perpetrators and executed the guilty warriors. The executions led to a civil war amongst the Creeks.
760. Letter from militia commander Thomas Johnson to Andrew Jackson updating him on the situation of the Crawley and Manley family murders. Johnson stated that the murders happened on May 12, and that he and 40 men looked for the "Indians who committed the murder," but "made no discoveries." The hostile warriors and their female captive had fled south to cross the Tennessee River into Creek territory. Jackson then apparently forward this report to Major [William] Bradford.
761. This letter from John Coffee detailed his experience at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Coffee reported to Jackson that "agreeably to his orders" Coffee set out with 700 mounted cavalry and mounted gunmen, 500 Cherokee, and 100 friendly Creeks, at 6:30 p.m. on March 27, 1814. His unit crossed the Tallapoosa River "at the little island ford, three miles below the bend, in which the enemy had concentrated." The enemy yelled, so Coffee formed up his lines and marched toward the yelling. They took the bank of the river to prevent their escape upon Jackson's frontal assault. Coffee reported that once the artillery barrage began, the enemy rushed toward the river bank "with great impetuosity." He explained that his troops crossed the river and lit a fire in the village.  Col. Gideon Morgan, commander of the Cherokees, Capt. Kerr, and Capt. William Russell were among the first that crossed the river. Coffee commended the actions of his Indian troops. He commented that Capt. Hammond's company of rangers 'kept up a continued and destructive fire on the enemy that attempted to escape into the river, and killed a very large proportion." Lieutenant Bean captured the island to prevent the Red Sticks from "seeking refuge" there. Coffee stated that "not one escaped, very few ever reached the bank, and that few was killed the instant they landed." He estimated that two-hundred and fifty to three hundred were "buried in the water." He also estimated that that his losses were "two white men killed and ten wounded - making the whole of my detachment, twenty five killed and fifty seven wounded."
762. John Coffee replied to Andrew Jackson Donelson's letter reporting the news that the ball in Jackson's arm from the 1813 shootout with the Benton brothers was about to be removed. Coffee wrote, "I rejoice to learn that the painful wound in the Genl's arm is about to be relieved by extracting the ball, which has remained in the arm, now about 18 years."  He praised Jackson's fortitude for continuing  to do business while enduring the painful wound. Jackson, of course, continued to carry a lead ball from his duel with Dickinson. The second page discussed Mr. [John] Branch and Mr. [Samuel D.] Ingham's feelings toward the president. The third page mentioned John C. Calhoun and Duff Green and their opposition to Jackson's administration.
763. On June 14, 1813, William Carroll and Jesse Benton dueled; Jackson, unable to calm the parties, served as Carroll's second. Later in 1813, Jackson and John Coffee crossed paths with Jesse and his brother Thomas Hart Benton outside of a tavern in Nashville. Thomas, angered by Jackson's inability to prevent the duel between his brother and Carroll, confronted Jackson, who drew a whip. Benton drew his gun and Jackson followed suit. Jesse approached from behind and both Bentons shot Jackson, who returned fire. Coffee came to Jackson's defense and shot at Thomas Hart Benton, but missed. Jackson took a ball to the upper part of his left arm. Doctors wanted to amputate the arm, but Jackson refused. Doctors were finally able to retrieve the ball about twenty years later.
764. Isaac Shelby and Andrew Jackson, commissioners of the Chickasaw Treaty of 1818, wrote to John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, informing him that they have successfully completed the treaty with the Chickasaw.  They reported that the Chickasaw  "ceded to the United States, all claim or title to the land within the States of Kentucky and Tennessee." They explained their travels to the treaty ground and negotiations that took place once there. They mention the Colberts' role in the treaty and their reserves.
765. The Chickasaw Treaty of 1818, also known as the Jackson Purchase, was the cession of land in west Tennessee and Kentucky by the Chickasaw Nation to the United States. The treaty was ratified on October 19, 1818. Andrew Jackson and Isaac Shelby served as commissioners on behalf of the United States.
766. During the British invasion of Louisiana, Major General Andrew Jackson imposed martial law. Following the Battle of New Orleans and news of the Treaty of Ghent, Judge Dominic Hall challenged Jackson's continuance of military rule. Jackson proceeded to throw Judge Hall in jail for disobedience. Once martial law was finally ended, Hall imposed a $1,000 fine on Jackson for contempt, which Jackson promptly paid. Later in life, Jackson lobbied Congress that he be repaid, which he finally was in 1844.
767. Letter signed by Andrew Jackson that explained the circumstances around the fine imposed by Judge Dominic Hall after the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson, intent on correcting the "falsehoods" published by a Mr. Botts in the Globe, repudiated the claim that the ladies of New Orleans paid his fine. Jackson stated, "The fine was paid by myself the moment the decision was announced, by a check given by A. L. Duncan and taken up by me, to prevent a vindictive judge from issuing a ca. sa." In defending his actions, Jackson called into question Mr. Bott's character and expounded on the legal circumstances that surrounded New Orleans during and after the British attack in 1814 and 1815.
768. The last will and testament of Andrew Jackson as of June 7, 1843, which amended his will of September 30, 1833. Jackson requested that he be buried "by the side of [his] dear departed wife in the garden of the Hermitage." Jackson specifically asked for his executor to pay off six thousand dollars to General J. B. Plauch's company. The purchase of Hiram G. Runnels' plantation in Mississippi, purchased by Andrew Jackson, Jr., is also mentioned. Jackson went on to mention a few other debts owed by him to be paid off at his death. Jackson bequeathed the Hermitage and all its adjacent land, furniture, slaves, stock, as well as the remainder of his estate after the payment of his debts to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. Andrew Jackson gave his granddaughter Rachel Jackson "several negroes." He left his grandson, Andrew Jackson, "a negro named Ned, son of blacksmith Aaron and Hannah his wife." He left his grandson Samuel Jackson "one negro boy, named Davy or George, son of Squire and his wife Geney." To his daughter-in-law Jackson reaffirms his marriage gift of "the negro girl Gracy... as her maid and seamstress with her increase, with my house servant Hanna, and her two daughters, namely Charlotte and Mary." Jackson left his nephew, Andrew Jackson Donelson "the elegant sword presented to [Jackson] by the State of Tennessee, with this injunction, that he not fail to use it when necessary, in support and protection of our glorious union." He left the sword given to him by Captain Beal's company of New Orleans to his nephew Andrew Jackson Coffee. He bequeathed the sword given to him by the citizens of Philadelphia to his grandson, Andrew Jackson. He left the pistols of General Lafayette to George Washington Lafayette. Jackson continued through his prized possessions gifting General Robert Armstrong his "case of pistols and sword worn by [Jackson] throughout [his] military career." Marion Adams, Elizabeth D. Long, Thomas J. Donelson, Richard Smith, and Robert Armstrong all signed the will as witnesses.
769. Amos Kendall, writing from Frankfort, Kentucky, confidentially disclosed to Jackson his experience during the 1824 election. He told Jackson that "Mr. Clay never treated me confidentially in relation to his arrangement with Adams." He claimed the he would have disclosed this information if Clay had informed him  He went on to say that one of Clay's friends told him of the arrangement on about January 20, 1825, and that he "was solicited three times to write to Mr. White, our representative, to vote for Adams on that account." Kendall believed so fervently that the suggestion of the arrangement came from Clay rather than Adams that he would "risk [his] honor and [his] life on the result of a thorough investigation." On the final page of the letter, Kendall attempted to curry favor with Jackson by praising his character and military exploits.
770. The 1824 presidential election was a fierce contest. Four frontrunners, Henry Clay, William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson, were identified as early as a year before the election. The results were highly regional, each candidate won his home state. Jackson received the most popular votes but failed to win a majority of electoral votes so the choice fell to the House of Representatives. Clay threw his support behind Adams, who ultimately won. Adams then appointed Clay as Secretary of State which infuriated Jackson and his supports who deemed it the "corrupt bargain."
771. Conveyance from the estate of Andrew Jackson in which the bequest of slaves left in his will to daughter-in-law Sarah Jackson is confirmed. His adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr., is conveying those slaves named in Jackson's will to his wife. Included were "one negro woman named Hannah of a yellow complexion aged about 55 years and her children, one a negro boy named George Washington and a negro girl named Mary with her increase. One negro man named Alfred of a yellow complexion aged about 38 years and his wife Grace, a negro woman aged about 35 years with their two children," Augustus, 12, and Sarah, 10. She was also left a "house-servant" named John Fulton, 35, and his wife Rachel, 34, and their three children, Billy, 15, Nelly, 12, and Johnny, 8. Also included were Byron, 32, and his wife, Nancy, 24. Andrew Jackson, Jr. and the Davidson County Clerk F. R. Cheatham signed the document.
772. The reference to "yellow complexion" is a description of these enslaved African Americans based on the antebellum South's fixation on skin color. According to the "one-drop rule," any degree of African American parentage, no matter how remote, put that individual in a lower caste. Even though many enslaved persons had European ancestry, these individuals were deemed black by Southern society and the planter class. These distinctions were made to impose a racial and social hierarchy within the enslaved population as a means of control.
773. After the Treaties of Velasco and the cession of the Texas territory, Mexicans continued to raid the border in an attempt to regain control. In 1842, Alexander Somervell led an expedition of 700 men to recapture these border towns. The Mier Expedition, a small operation within the greater Somervell Expedition, involved 308 Texan militia who ignored orders to return home. They successfully captured Ciudad Mier, but encountered a Mexican detachment, 3,000 strong, five days later. Outnumbered tenfold, the Texans left 650 dead and 200 wounded but were ultimately overwhelmed and the remaining 243 Texans were taken prisoner. On February 11, 181 prisoners escaped as they marched toward Mexico City, but due to the inhospitable surroundings, most were recaptured. A furious Santa Anna ordered the execution of all escapees. This led to the Black Bean Episode, where the Mexican captors placed 176 white beans and seventeen black beans into a pot and ordered the Texans to draw beans. All seventeen who drew black beans were executed by firing squad.
774. Letter (and translation) from Mexican Presidente Santa Anna to American President Andrew Jackson, written just weeks after the Black Bean Episode, in which Santa Anna had ordered the execution of 17 captured Texans. The letter began discussing prisoner exchange, specifically George Crittenden. Santa Anna rebuked Texan forays into Mexican territory. He then discussed the prisoner escape that occurred on February 11, 1843, and denounced the actions of the escapees. He went on to justify the execution of the prisoners and stated that it "avoided butchery [evitardo asi los horrores de una carniceria]" and that "nobody [could] dispute to Mexico the legality of the acts [nadie podrá disputar á la megicana la legalidad de ecta providencia.]." On the final page, Jackson asked for a translation. The original letter is written on elaborate letterhead of the Presidente de la Republica.
775. Andrew Jackson, Joseph McMinn, and David Meriwether served as commissioners for the Cherokee Treaty of 1817. This document was written in the negotiation phase of the treaty, just 6 months before ratification. The treaty recognized the division between Upper and Lower Cherokee as well as arranged an exchange of lands in East Tennessee for land in Arkansas Territory. It also began the process of voluntary emigration to the Arkansas Territory, the first phase of large scale Indian removal, which was overseen by Joseph McMinn. It provided 640 acre reservations for those heads of family that wished to remain east of the Mississippi and become U.S. citizens. This treaty was signed, but disputed by the Cherokee until the Cherokee Treaty of 1819.
776. Jackson reported that he reached "Highwassee" on the 11th when he heard the Col. [Return J.] Meiggs [Meigs] had changed the meeting place to the Cherokee Agency. He met with the Cherokee delegation the prior day, and they had "expressed great anxiety for an exchange of territory." Jackson was respected by native Americans in such treaty negotiations, and he considered himself a man of liberal sentiments concerning their situation. He expressed sympathy for how the Cherokee were being exploited, saying that "a few white men and half breeds...have and are still fattening on the annuities of the nation and the labour of the poor Indians." Jackson stated that General David Meriwether accompanied him and he had "no doubt" that they would "obtain half if not all the territory here for lands on the Arkansaw." Jackson concluded with business and land dealings between the two men, specifically the sale of land in Alabama.
777. John Overton was Jackson's closest advisor and confidante. He often wrote to Overton, discussing Washington politics, local and national affairs, land speculation and gossip. As president, Jackson eyed the rich Indian lands in Georgia and North Carolina, and ordered tribal evacuation beyond the Mississippi River. The Indian Removal, which uprooted the Cherokee and Creek, remains a sensitive and controversial topic. Jackson was an early proponent of expanding western lands, and this letter illustrates his contempt for the "late Treaty with Spain," a reference to the Adams-Onis boundaries with Mexico.  Although the Adams-Onis Treaty (1819) secured U.S. acquisition of Florida and protected New Orleans, it limited American expansion into Texas and beyond. Jackson believed the treaty favored Northern interests and suffocated the South's hope to extend its western boundaries.
778. Six-page letter in which Jackson discussed with his good friend Overton several state, national, and personal issues: westward expansion, importance of Texas, Cherokee Removal, and the Bank of the United States. He commented on political luminaries of the day such as William Carroll, Felix Grundy, and John C. Calhoun. Of the Adams-Onis Treaty, he wrote that it   .must have been with the view to keep the political ascendancy in the North, and east, & cripple the rising greatness of the west. The letter sheds much light on Jackson's position on the need, as he believed, for Indian removal from their native lands. Jackson appointed William Carroll as representative to the Cherokee and Creek Indians and counseled him to "give them my talk on the subject of their removal to the west of the Mississippi." He was "to use his influence in conjunction with the agent to enforce upon their minds the neccessity [sic] of their adopting this course, as the only means we have in preserving them as nations and of protecting them." The State of Georgia had extended their civil Jurisdiction over them, making it "desirable that the Indians should remove to a Territory over which no state has any right to the soil  The course pursued by Georgia is well calculated to involve her & the United States in great dificulty [sic], unless the Indians can be got to move west of the M.  Jackson suggested a change in the incorporated Bank to that of a national bank, believing this to be the only way to prevent the U.S. Bank from rechartering. He continued with, "I believe this is the only thing that can prevent our liberties to be crushed by the Bank." Jackson briefly discussed Major John Eaton, telling Overton, "I can say with truth there never was a man more cruelly treated than Major Eaton, and by some of my friends." He expressed his unhappiness as president, disclosing that the only reason to continue is that "my country has required it and it is a duty I have to that country." He concluded by reaffirming two policies he wished to pursue: have the constitution amended to create a national bank and extend the western boundary. The President ended on a cheerless note about the next term's effects on his already fragile health. The thought gave him "serious forebodings that I shall not spend much of my time in this world on the silent walks of the Hermitage."
779. Jackson wrote to Coffee to inform him he had "concluded a treaty with the Cherokee delegation." He explained the treaty stipulations and negotiations in detail mentioning the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Cherokee. He closed with the reason no reservations were offered --because the land was disputed with other nations.
780. The Cherokee Treaty of 1816 ceded land south of the Tennessee River in Alabama in exchange for $6000 per annum for ten years and $5000 for improvements. Jackson concluded a treaty with the Chickasaw the following day.
781. Brigadier General Daniel S. Donelson wrote to his brother, Andrew Jackson Donelson, regarding the Eaton Affair. Donelson reported that "Eaton and his wife arrived at this place on Monday last."  He stated that "the wives of the office holders and members have and are giving in their adherence." He knew "of but one exception to their rule of action that of McLane." He informed his brother that a dinner was held for the "redoubtable Major," the previous Saturday. He claimed that "the president was so completely identified with Eaton that a refusal to pay him attention would be assuming a hostile attitude to the president himself." Daniel Donelson believed that the American people misunderstood the "unpleasant affair." He concluded that the letter had been written in "great haste."
782. The Eaton Affair, also known as the Petticoat Affair, was a political scandal involving Jackson's cabinet Jackson's Secretary of War, John Eaton, and his new wife. The cabinet members and their wives, led by the Vice-President's wife Floride Calhoun, spurned Eaton and his wife, Peggy, over the morality of their marriage. This led to the resignation of nearly all of Jackson's cabinet and the rise of Martin Van Buren, who defended the Eatons.
783. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was the grandson of Rachel's sister Catherine. His parents, John Hutchings and Polly Smith Hutchings, died in 1817, when A. J. was only 5. He lived with Andrew and Rachel as a ward, until it was time for him to attend college. He married John Coffee's daughter, Mary, in 1833. Hutchings died in 1841.
784. Jackson wrote his former ward, A. J. Hutchings, regarding the Hermitage and the death of two his enslaved persons. Jackson wrote that he "sincerely regret[ted] the loss of they two sampsons" and this it did not occur "from neglect or inhumanity, but from the will of our creator." He was informed that neglect may have been the cause of the death of the enslaved Titus and Anade. Jackson expressed delight that Hutchings had begun managing his own estate and warned him of those who might try to swindle him. He mentioned Dr. Hagg and a payment to Hutchings. He asked about Hutchings family, specifically John Coffee, Mary Coffee, Thomas J. Donelson, Samuel Donelson, and Severn Donelson. He discussed farm business, crops, slaves, and management. He told Hutchings to "seek a wife, one who will aid you in your assertions" and know how to manage money. He used Rachel, John Coffee, and Polly [Mary Coffee] as examples. He warned him of debt, saying "if you get in debt, you become a slave."
785. Jackson wrote to his friend Colonel Robert Hays from his headquarters at Fort Strother, Alabama. He reported that [members of] General Isaac Roberts Brigade were "risqueing [sic] all the penalties of desertion, sedition, and mutiny, and determined to leave the encampment contrary to my orders." He implored Hays not to muster them out, unless expressly ordered by Governor Blount. Jackson detailed the unit's muster and the mustering in of Colonel John Williams' regiment. He explained recent letters he sent to General John Floyd and Governor Blount. He concluded with a note asking Hays to tell his wife he was well and that he hoped to be able to use his arm soon (his arm was injured in a gun fight with the Benton brothers the year before). A postscript mentioned other letters he expected and wanted to know if his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. had "got his little Lyncoya" and what his thoughts were.
786. Robert Hays was born in Salisbury, North Carolina in 1758. He fought in the Revolutionary War and thus received a land grant in Middle Tennessee. He met and married Jane Donelson, Rachel Donelson Jackson's sister. In Davidson County, his property took the name Haysboro. He served as trustee to the Davidson Academy, representative to the North Carolina legislature from Davidson County, colonel of cavalry, justice of the peace, and deputy inspector general during the War of 1812. He died in 1819.
787. D. O. Dunham, aide-de-camp of General Thomas McIntosh, wrote Jackson to update him on their actions, including that he sent out detachments and raiding and "depredations" by the Creeks. He lamented that they had been at Fort Hawkins so long.  McIntosh informed Jackson that "a regiment of blacks sailed from Jamaica, some time since for New Orleans."
788. Jackson responded to Chester's letter of October 25. He stated that "no complaints here of General Purdy" and that he had not heard if Purdy planned to resign. Jackson promised Chester that his "enemy" would not be appointed. He mentioned that one of his slaves, Charlotte, requested that Chester purchase her. Jackson explained that he first purchased Charlotte at the request of her husband Charles, but now "he appears desirous that she with her children be sold." He discussed a "great reduction of hands on [his] plantation" due to deaths in 1829. The remainder of the letter discussed the payment for Charlotte and her three children. He concluded with a mention of appointed S. D. Hays as surveyor, but that it might be opposed in the Senate, even with [David] Crockett and [Robert] Desha representing him.
789. Robert I. Chester was born in Pennsylvania, but grew up in Jonesboro, Tennessee. He served as quartermaster of the 3rd Tennessee regiment during the War of 1812. After the war, he became a merchant and surveyor in Carthage, until he moved to Jackson where he became postmaster. Sam Houston appointed him colonel in the Texas Revolutionary Army, but returned to Jackson by 1836. President Martin Van Buren appointed Chester U. S. Marshal for the western district, and served until the Civil War. After the war, Chester was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1869 to 1873.
790. Rachel Donelson Jackson was the youngest child of John Donelson and Rachel Stockley Donelson. At the age of 12, Rachel accompanied her family down the Cumberland River to Fort Nashborough. She married Captain Lewis Robards, but the unhappy couple soon separated. Rachel believed her husband filed for divorce during this tumultuous time. A young attorney named Andrew Jackson boarded at the Donelson home, where he first met Rachel. The two married in Natchez, Mississippi in 1791. This marriage was considered invalid because she was never officially divorced from Robards. This unfortunate circumstance troubled the couple for the remainder of their lives. After an official divorce was granted in 1794, Rachel and Andrew were officially married in Davidson County. They adopted the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, in 1806 and named him Andrew Jackson, Jr. Rachel died in 1828, shortly before Andrew took office as president
791. Rachel Jackson wrote to her brother, John Donelson, from Pensacola, Florida, complaining of Spaniards, Seminoles and the bad climate and discussing her husband's experience as Florida's military governor. She missed home, and felt that her health was "delicate." The concluding paragraph is filled with rambling scriptural quotations from the Book of Isaiah and communications for family members.
792. Deposition of Andrew Greer from 1803, in which he described a confrontation on the road in Knox County between Governor John Sevier and Judge Andrew Jackson; pistols and swords were drawn.
793. The bitter feud between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson grew out of a dispute over military appointments both men competed over a position as major general of the Tennessee militia. The relationship between Sevier and Jackson deteriorated after Jackson accused Sevier of land fraud, asserting that Sevier conspired to destroy original records of land ownership, replacing them with forged claims. On October 1, 1803, the two men met on the steps of the Old Knox County Courthouse and traded heated words. Gov. Sevier brandished his sword, dared Jackson to draw arms, then insulted Jackson's wife, Rachel, resulting in a physical confrontation. Jackson lunged at Sevier with his cane, then friends of both parties drew pistols, and shots rang out as a bullet grazed at least one bystander. After allies of both men separated the two, a war of words between the governor and the judge quickly escalated in an exchange of letters. In their correspondence, Jackson requested an 'interview' with Sevier--a commonly understood term for a duel. Dueling, however, was prohibited within the borders of Tennessee, so Sevier offered to meet Jackson at any time and place not within the State of Tennessee. Thereafter the two men argued over the timing and location to settle their dispute. Eventually, Jackson met Sevier near present-day Kingston, Tennessee, where a failed attempt at a duel took place. Loyalists to both men provided conflicting accounts and details surrounding the chaotic events of that day in sworn affidavits signed by witnesses, and in published newspaper accounts of the incident. Ultimately, tempers cooled, but the animosity between Sevier and Jackson remained until Sevier's death in 1815. (Belt, Gordon T., and Traci Nichols-Belt. John Sevier: Tennessee's First Hero. Charleston: The History Press, 2014.)
794. Lewis wrote Coffee  because he had not heard from him since leaving the Chickasaw treaty ground in northern Mississippi territory. He requested an update on treaty negotiations with the Chickasaw from either Coffee or Thomas Hinds. In regard to the treaty negotiations, Lewis remarked that the "government is so liberally disposed towards its red children." He estimated that the Federal government would grant the Chickasaw $20,000 in annuities and an additional sum to the chiefs; it would also build schools for the Chickasaw. The latter measure was seen as one of the chief means of assimilating or Americanizing native Americans. He told Coffee that his health was recovered, and hoped that Coffee's family was well. Lewis remarked that Coffee should get the "political news" from General Jackson.
795. Jackson began the letter defending himself against Col. John Williams's "false" and "malicious" charge of fraud in the matter of Florida land transactions. Jackson later discussed his role in the Chickasaw treaty of 1818 and the commercial potential of the salt lick contained within the treaty's bounds.
796. Lewis wrote Coffee to report that "The floodgates of falsehood, slander, and abuse [had] been hoisted, and the most nauseating filth is poured, in torrents, on the head of ... General Jackson." He accused Adams's and Clay's supporters of losing "all sense of decency." Lewis informed Coffee that Jackson's enemies accused him of being a "negroe [sic] trader" in regard to a contested slave transaction between Jackson, John Hutchings, and "old Rawlings." Lewis defended Jackson's role in the transaction, saying that he "had nothing to do with it." Lewis also reported that some of Governor Isaac Shelby's family "charged the general with having acted corruptly at the Chickasaw Treaty of 1818, relative to the purchase of the Colbert Reservations." Lewis asked Coffee if Jimmy [James] Jackson had any hand in that accusation and the details of the treaty.
797. William Berkeley Lewis was a longtime friend and associate of Andrew Jackson. He was appointed quartermaster under Jackson during the War of 1812 and assisted Jackson's 1823 campaign for the Senate and his presidential campaigns. Once president, Jackson appointed Lewis second auditor of the treasury.
798. Rev. Nathaniel Lawrence wrote to his nephew, Dr. William P. Lawrence, regarding a number of ecclesiastical issues. He discussed various Christian publications in Nashville. He expressed delight that Jackson had joined a local church, "the accession to the church of one who lately filled the most dignified office in the United States and presided as chief of our entire republick [sic]." He continued, "When such great men... make truth their deliberate choice...and lend their influence to Christianity" and "embrace Immanuel's Cross...it must produce a full tide of in describable and unutterable joy." He concluded with a discussion of his nephew's faith.
799. In early 1806, Andrew Jackson and Charles Dickinson engaged in a disagreement over a horserace involving Jackson and Dickinson's father-in-law, Joseph Erwin. In the midst of this disagreement, Dickinson publicly insulted Jackson's wife, Rachel. Insults were made back and forth until Jackson ultimately challenged Dickinson to a duel on May 23, 1806. On May 30, 1806, the two men and their seconds met at Harrison's Mill, Kentucky, to settle their dispute. Knowing Dickinson's reputation as a marksman, Jackson planned to hold his fire and hope that Dickinson missed in his rush to fire. The two men formally paced until they were 20 feet apart when one of the seconds shouted, "Fire!" Dickinson shot first hitting Jackson in the chest; the ball broke ribs and lodged close to the heart. Though injured, Jackson slowly aimed and hit Dickinson in the abdomen. Dickinson died later that evening. Jackson carried the ball from the duel the rest of his life
800. This document is a handwritten copy of a series of letters between Andrew Jackson, Charles Dickinson, Thomas Overton, and Hanson Catlet regarding the duel that ultimately resulted in Dickinson's death. The sequence of these exchanges begins with Charles Dickinson publishing an article on Andrew Jackson insulting Jackson "with blackguards abuse." Jackson sent Dickinson a letter inviting him to satisfy the insults by means of a duel. Dickinson accepted and the terms of the duel were settled by Thomas Overton and Hanson Catlet, acting as 'seconds' on behalf of Jackson and Dickinson, respectively. Thomas Overton requested that the duel happen as soon as possible and offered to provide pistols if Dickinson could not obtain one. They agreed upon a date and time for the "affair of honor," which was given as seven in the morning on May 30, 1806 across the state line at Harrison's Mill in Logan County, Kentucky. They also agreed that Jackson and Dickinson would stand 24 feet apart, facing each other with their pistols drawn until someone called "Fire."
801. This Democratic publication was published at the height of the 1828 presidential campaign. The front-page article titled "War, Pestilence, and Famine." rebutted Henry Clay's speech directed at Andrew Jackson. An excerpt of Jackson's address to John Wood[s] speaking to the necessity of dealing harshly with mutiny spanned the first and second pages. Other mentions of Jackson and the other candidates are included in other articles, as are unrelated articles.
802. Typical of the partisan political press of the early Jacksonian era, The Castigator, also titled Old Hickory, or, the Castigator was a weekly Democratic Party newspaper published in Auburn and Ithaca, New York from 1823-1829, by James M. Miller. Miller published under the pseudonyms Major Club and Captain Cudgel.
803. Confidential letter from Ephraim Foster, an early Jackson protégé and political operative, to John Coffee. He began the letter discussing the Tariff of 1828. However "these speculations [were] not the business of this letter." Foster reported that slanderous newspapers were "attempting to break down Genl Jackson." He specified the report of the execution of John Woods, a popular anti-Jackson point of attack, had made the papers. Foster requested a "true statement of that matter" from Coffee. He expected Jackson to win the presidency, but implored Coffee's assistance, demanding that "activity and vigilance must be the order of the day." He concluded by saying that Jackson was in "excellent health and spirits." A postscript, written by John C.[Christmas] McLemore discussed raising money to rebut the slanders against Jackson and mentioned William B. Lewis, Foster, and Thomas Crutcher as other contributors.
804. Ephraim Foster served as Jackson's secretary during the War of 1812, attorney, Tennessee state representative and Speaker of the House,  and United States Senator from Tennessee. He later turned against Jackson politically and became a Whig.
805. About a year after Rachel Jackson's death, Overton wrote to Ralph Earl a fond reminiscence of his good friend's wife. Overton, who had boarded with the Donelson family in the 1790s, praised her as "amiable" and "ever-to-be-lamented," seeking to vindicate her from the "unjust aspersions unwantonly introduced in the presidential canvas."  He mentioned knowing her in her younger years, full of "naivette [sic], simplicity, and innocence." He praised her character later in life as well and stated she was "serene and happy" with Jackson until rival newspapers began publishing scurrilous attacks because of the questionable circumstances of her youthful elopement with Jackson. The letter was kept in a scrapbook by Andrew Jackson.
806. John Overton was perhaps Jackson's closest advisor and confidante. Jackson often wrote to Overton, discussing Washington politics, local and national affairs, gossip, and land speculation. Overton served as federal tax collector on the whiskey tax from 1796 until 1803 and was elected to replace Jackson as judge of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, where he served until 1810. He and Jackson were partners in land speculation and co-founded the city of Memphis. Overton lived at his plantation near Nashville, Traveller's Rest.
807. Pennsylvania congressman Buchanan reported that Jackson's friends considered Calhoun's presidential nomination "impolitic," and that "Major Eaton never wrote a letter to Harrisburg advising that measure." He reported that there was much discussion about how New York would vote, with both Adams' and Crawford's supporters claiming it in their column. Buchanan "consider[ed] Clay as much out of the question as Calhoun." He guessed that Jackson's success "depend[ed] on the electoral votes... unless a great change should take place in the House of Representatives." Buchanan referred to Jackson as a "noble old fellow." He concluded the letter with an update on the tariff bill moving through Congress. President Jackson later appointed Buchanan as Minister to Russia.
808. From the Rose Sheet Music Collection, this musical interpretation of the Battle of New Orleans consists of a ten page piece of sheet music written for the piano. This is an early example of a long line of celebratory music based on Jackson's triumph over the British foe at New Orleans.
809. Andrew Jackson's handwritten, official report of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend to Governor Willie Blount. Gen. Jackson goes into considerable detail about his approach to the Red Stick Creek's fortified bend of the Tallapoosa River, which "barbarians have never rendered...more secure by art." Jackson specifically commends the conduct of his Cherokee allies, "headed by their gallant Chieftain Col. Richard Brown." A hand-drawn map depicting the battle prefaces the written report, in which Jackson gives a blow-by-blow account of the battle and its aftermath. Horseshoe Bend was a decisive victory for Jackson's Tennesseans--the "slaughter," he says, "was suspended only by the darkness of night"--and Creek military power was broken.
810. Labeled a "true copy" of a letter from Lincoyer, Andrew Jackson's adopted Creek son, to "Dear Father." In this plaintive letter, Lincoyer addresses his status in the Jackson household and asks Jackson, "If the Mad Wolfe and Ogilvrie call thee father, may not Lincoyer, and be justified?" The authenticity of this letter has come under scrutiny.
811. Lincoyer[also written Lyncoya, or Lincoya], a Creek child, was found on the battlefield at Tallushatchee, lying next to his slain mother. Jackson took in the child and raised him alongside his own adopted son Andrew Jackson Jr. Lincoyer died of tuberculosis in 1828.
812. One of the published 'coffin broadsides' used to attack Jackson during the electoral campaign of 1828. This particular broadside is unique in that it depicts the executions rather than just the coffins. An engraving of the executions of six Tennessee militiamen accused of mutiny during the Creek War is located at the center top. The execution of John Woods by firing squad is depicted to the left. An attack on Jackson's conduct during the Battle of Horseshoe Bend is located in the very center. Jackson's deadly duel with Charles Dickinson is recounted in the bottom right, and his fracas with Thomas Hart Benton and his brother, Jesse, in the bottom left. As the title implies, the overall message of this political campaign document was that Jackson is a violent, intemperate man prone to "bloody deeds."
813. The election of 1828 was one of the most contentious and unscrupulous of the 19th century. Many published attacks on Jackson's character and supposed misdeeds circulated the country. Jackson's supporters denounced John Quincy Adams for promising the Secretary of State position to Henry Clay in return for his support in the 1824 election. Jackson prevailed four years later, winning 56% of the popular vote.
814. Silhouette portrait of Andrew Jackson from William Henry Brown's Portrait Gallery of Distinguished American Citizens.  The portrait depicts Jackson as an older man, well dressed with cane and top hat, overlooking his bucolic plantation and home, the Hermitage.
815. As the chief spokesman for the increasingly aggressive rights of the slaveholding South, John C. Calhoun was one of the giants of antebellum American politics. He served as War Hawk congressman, Secretary of War (1817-1825), Vice President (1825-1832) and US Senator (1835-1850).
816. Portrait engraving of South Carolinian John C. Calhoun based on Matthew Brady's daguerreotype completed around 1849. Calhoun's stern visage is an iconic image of the old states rights warrior, proto-secessionist, and nemesis of his Unionist fellow Southerner, Andrew Jackson.
817. Equestrian lithograph that depicts Major General Andrew Jackson in uniform. He holds a saber in his right hand.
818. A letter from Andrew Jackson to an unnamed colonel that recommended Lieutenant Samuel Houston as sub-agent in the removal of Cherokee from East Tennessee. In the letter, he mentions Nicholas Byers, one of the proprietors of the Unicoi Turnpike.
819. A hand-colored lithograph of the Hermitage published shortly after Jackson's death. Jackson and Rachel's tomb, overhung by a willow, the symbol of mourning, is depicted to the right of the main house, before the prominent gardens were added. Lush woods surround the imposing, white-columned mansion as cattle graze on the front lawn. An unidentified man stands in the road.
820. Andrew Jackson won the presidential election of 1828 after losing to John Quincy Adams in 1824 in what Jackson called the 'corrupt bargain'. Jackson, known as the 'people's candidate,' gained his renown from winning the Battle of New Orleans against the British in the War of 1812. Jackson's two terms in office were transformative and controversial, with his presidency weathering the Nullification Crisis and overseeing the Indian Removal Act and the Bank Wars. Jackson was known for his heavy handed governance, with many vetoes and clashes with Congress during his presidency.
821. This broadside shows the presidential electors from Pennsylvania for the 1828 election. It has a large picture of Andrew Jackson surrounded by military memorabilia and one of his campaign slogans "Democracy, Jackson, and Our Country." Beneath Jackson are the words "The Union must be preserved," a reference to Jackson's strong unionist stance against John Calhoun and the nullification doctrine.
822. John Rice was granted 5,000 acres along the Mississippi River on the Fourth Chickasaw Bluff in 1789 by the state of North Carolina. John Overton purchased it from Rice's brother Elisha Rice in 1794 for £1,000. Overton sold half of the tract to Andrew Jackson, who sold a portion of his claim to James Winchester for $5,000. The land along the river was set aside as public land to lay out the city of Memphis.
823. Plat showing the division of the 5,000 acre John Rice tract on the Fourth Chickasaw Bluff that would later be the site of Memphis, Tennessee. This division was between the three men credited with being the founders of Memphis--John Overton, Andrew Jackson, and James Winchester. John Rice, a land speculator, had bought the warrant for this North Carolina grant from Secretary of State John Armstrong's office in the 1780s when this land was Indian territory. Rice was murdered by the Cherokee warrior Doublehead in 1792, long before this part of West Tennessee was opened for settlement by Jackson's treaty with the Chickasaw in 1818.
824. During Jackson's presidential administration, he replaced many Republican officeholders with loyal Democrats that supported him. Jackson believed that instead of civil servants having lifetime jobs people needed to be rotated into office and give more people a chance to serve their government. Jackson's opponents called the practice of rewarding political supporters with government jobs the spoils system.
825. This political cartoon is a sepia print of a winged demon with the head of Andrew Jackson, hovering in the sky holding strings connected to symbols and objects representing political offices. This cartoon depicts the "spoils system" of rewarding the political loyalists with offices and thereby changing government appointees with each election. Clearly expressive of anti-Jackson sentiments, the cartoon shows among other images a withered witch holding a Roman lictor and a tree with two hanged militiamen, an allusion to Jackson's summary execution of men during the Creek War.
826. This cartoon interprets the public's response to the 1833 Bank War during Andrew Jackson's presidency. Jackson, curly-tailed and prone over a fire pit, is depicted as a hog roasting on the fire of "public opinion" by the figure of Justice. The fire is stoked by former Secretary of the Treasury William Duane while Jack Downing splits kindling. Standing behind the pit are Senators Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William B. Preston, Nicholas Biddle, and an unidentified fifth man. Vice-president Martin Van Buren, also shown as a pig, is in the upper right hand corner carrying a bag of treasury notes.
827. In March 1814, Jackson charged John Woods, an eighteen year old militiaman, with disobedience, disrespect, and mutiny and offered him reprieve if he joined the regular army. Woods declined the offer, so Jackson had him executed. Jackson's opponents used this broadside to attack his character during his presidential campaigns.
828. Political broadside published in 1828 to oppose Jackson's presidential candidacy. Styled as a 'monument' to the slain young militiaman, it explained the execution of John Woods in an emotional plea to would-be voters. The emboldened words "shot to death" and the explanation of Woods' "adherence to duty" characterized Jackson as a vindictive military tyrant.
829. This lithograph depicts Clark Mills's equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson that stands just outside the White House in Lafayette Park. The statue depicts a triumphant Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans and the base includes the inscription, "Our federal union it must be preserved"--a reference to Jackson's famous Unionist toast. Identical copies of Mills's bronze statue stand in Lafayette Square, New Orleans, and on Capitol hill in Nashville.
830. This statue, commissioned in 1847 and completed in 1852,  commemorated Jackson's victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. Clark Mills, with help from his enslaved apprentice Phillip Reid, cast the piece in ten sections. The White House Historical Association states that it was first bronze statue cast in the United States and first two legged equestrian statue in the world.
831. Half-length engraving of Major General Andrew Jackson around the time of the Battle of New Orleans, in surcoat and general officer's uniform, leaning against his horse. This engraving was done by James Barton Longacre based on Thomas Sully's painting.
832. This hand-colored engraving depicts the Battle of New Orleans from the perspective of the Americans. It shows General Andrew Jackson, General [Richard Keith] Call, and Major [Edward] Livingston as they confer on horseback beneath the American flag.  They are surrounded by American troops defending the breastworks from attacking British troops. A dense smoke blankets the battlefield. In the distance, ships can be seen on the Mississippi River. Troop numbers and casualties--disproportionately heavy for the British--are listed below the engraving.
833. In 1831, France finally agreed to repay the United States 25 million francs for the disruption of American shipping during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1824, after a failure to pay, Jackson issued a warning and threatened to seize French property. In 1835, the French government agreed to begin repayment only if Jackson apologized, which Jackson refused to do. In December 1835, Jackson backed down from his threat, but steadfastly refused to apologize. This was satisfactory in the eyes of the French, who began reparations shortly thereafter.
834. Political cartoon depicting the dispute between the United States and France over war indemnifications from the Napoleonic Wars. Reparations were sought by the Jackson administration for damages to American merchant shipping by French privateers before and during the War of 1812. In the cartoon, Jackson, as a lion bellowing his famous "By the Eternal" oath, refuses to apologize to Louis-Philippe, the Gallic rooster. Jackson stands on a bag of money with the inscription 25,000,000.
835. The story of Balaam and his donkey is a biblical reference from Numbers: 22. Balaam was a sorcerer who, promised with riches, was asked by King Balak of the Moabites to curse the fleeing Israelites. His donkey, which could see the angel of God blocking his path with a sword, tried three times to prevent Balaam from proceeding and was beaten for its actions. God spoke angrily to Balaam through the donkey and opened his eyes to see the angel present. Balaam then blessed the Israelites rather than cursed them.
836. This political cartoon, a hostile allegory of Jackson's quixotic and failed Specie Circular, depicts President Jackson as the Old Testament figure Balaam (Numbers: 22), cane in hand, riding his ass who is carrying a saddlebag of "specie currency circulating medium." The angel of the story is shown holding a flaming sword with the inscription "Protest, $200,000." Martin van Buren follows Jackson while saying "I shall tread in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessor!" The text balloons in the cartoon are accurate renderings of the scriptural dialogue amongst the angel, Balaam and his talking ass.
837. This political cartoon is a satire on Jackson's monetary policy. Jackson is shown standing on the Constitution, holding a spade labeled veto, while Martin Van Buren stands beside him urging him to "Drive on Ginral or we will be too late for the Packet." They lead a cart labeled "salary for foreign ministers" which holds bags of money labeled $9,000. The cart is led by two oxen identified as Amos Kendall and Roger Taney. Two ladies and their children exclaim, "Alas, we were ruined with the Bank!" A beggar asks for money. The back drop shows dilapidateed houses in an almost post-apocalyptic landscape.
838. Jean Hyacinthe Laclotte was a French architect and artist. In 1810, he began an architectural partnership with Arsène LaTour. By 1813 his firm went bankrupt and Laclotte volunteered for the Louisiana militia as an engineer. His painting, based on battlefield sketches, was made into an engraving by Philibert-Louis Debucourt and mass produced.
839. Jean Hyacinthe Laclotte's detailed drawing of the Battle of New Orleans on Chalmette Plain based on his painting of the same. Many not necessarily simultaneous events are depicted in Laclotte's rendering, including British infantry carrying fascines to scale the American breastworks, fighting at the artillery redoubt on Jackson's right, behind which are buckskin-clad troops. Packenham's attack on the American center appears to have already been repulsed, and, toward the top, British soldiers are shown carrying someone on a stretcher, possibly the mortally wounded Packenham. A caped Jackson is depicted just below the American flag, near the center of the breastworks in front of the Rodriguez House.
840. Broadside from the Examiner published in Nashville, November 2, 1814, with a plea for volunteers from Major General William Carroll. Carroll, as commander of the Tennessee militia, had been tasked by the US military departmental commander, Andrew Jackson, with raising 5000 militia to defend New Orleans from British attack. Addressed to "Brave Tennesseans," the broadside exhorts citizens to abandon the "dull pursuits of private life" and repel the "hosts of Britain" threatening to invade the Gulf Coast and take New Orleans. The appeal to a specifically American, anti-British patriotism as well as the manifest interest in securing New Orleans and the Mississippi River--an ever-present concern of early Tennesseans--is prominent in this document.
841. Upon Andrew Jackson's appointment as Major General in the US Army, Carroll replaced him as Major General of the Tennessee militia. After the Creek War, Carroll returned to Nashville to raise a militia to defend New Orleans from British attack. During the Battle of New Orleans, his Tennessee volunteers defended the center, where the primary British attack was focused. After the victory, Carroll became a Tennessee hero, second in stature only to Jackson. He served six terms as governor of Tennessee from 1821 until 1835, except for the two years that Sam Houston and William Hall held the office from 1827 to 1829.
842. Brief report of numerical strength of Major General Andrew Jackson's division of Tennessee militia made late in the Creek War. Generals John Coffee, George Doherty, and Thomas Johnson's  brigades were broken down into privates present for duty, total present or duty; sick, wounded, and on detachment; and the aggregate. This total was taken shortly after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Signed by James Sitler, adjutant general.
843. From the Rose Sheet Music Collection, this sheet music cover includes a black and white illustration of a young Andrew Jackson in major general's uniform. The song was arranged for piano by Mr. Peile.
844. An invitation to attend Andrew Jackson's funeral that was held on June 10, 1845, at the Hermitage.
845. Andrew Jackson died of heart failure on June 8, 1845, from complications of tuberculosis.
846. Broadside reprint by "We the people..." of a proclamation by Jesse Benton from City Hotel in Nashville that explained his attacks on Jackson in 1824. To establish Jackson's cruelty, Benton brought up the execution of six militiamen and twelve regulars in 1815. Benton attacked Jackson's honesty by discussing his role as Chickasaw Treaty commissioner, and the lands in formerly Chickasaw territory given to his friends. See "Nashville Gazette, extra" item (43134) from Jackson Materials, Addition.
847. The election of 1828 was one of the most contentious and unscrupulous of the 19th century. Many published attacks on Jackson's character and supposed misdeeds circulated the country. Jackson's supporters denounced John Quincy Adams for promising the Secretary of State position to Henry Clay in return for his support in the 1824 election. Jackson prevailed, winning 56% of the popular vote.
848. A map of the December 23rd night attack south of New Orleans. American troops are hand-colored in blue, while the British are red. Levees, ditches, plantation properties, fences, Gen Kean's headquarters, and the damaged schooner Carolina are all depicted. Geographic features include the Mississippi River, canals, and a cypress swamp. Annotations on the troop units, British landing site and other locations are included.
849. General John Coffee's victory at the Battle of Tallushatchee left 154 friendly Creek surrounded at Fort Leslie near Talladega, Alabama. One Creek warrior draped himself in a hog skin and sneaked by the besieging Red Sticks to warn Jackson of their dire situation. Major General Andrew Jackson marched 2000 Tennessee militia from Fort Strother to lift the siege. On November 9, 1813, Jackson's militia surrounded the attackers, killing 300 enemy warriors while sustaining only 15 dead. They successfully broke the siege, but their encirclement failed and the bulk of the Red Sticks escaped.
850. Map of the Battle of Talladega from John Eaton's The Life of Andrew Jackson, Major-General in the Service of the United States. It shows the hilltop fort of the "friendly Creeks" who were besieged by "hostile Creeks" or Red Sticks during the Creek War. Jackson's army is shown surrounding the hostile Creeks and divided into units of infantry, cavalry, and mounted gunmen.
851. A published version of Andrew Jackson's first inaugural address. In his speech, Jackson outlined his vision for the country. He led off by addressing the crowd as "fellow citizens," confirming his image as man of the people. He remarked that he would respect the limitations of the executive branch as well as the rights of the states. He championed internal improvement, proper management of the revenue, and "a just and liberal policy" toward Native Americans. He opposed enlarging the army but favored an increase of the navy. An artistic border surrounds the text.
852. The election of 1828 was one of the most contentious and hard-fought of the 19th century. Many published attacks on Jackson's character and supposed misdeeds circulated throughout the country. Jackson's supporters denounced John Quincy Adams for having promised the Secretary of State position to Henry Clay in return for his support in the 1824 election. Jackson prevailed, winning 56% of the popular vote.
853. Photograph of the copy of Clark Mills's equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson that stands on the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol. Looking eastward, It shows the elegant 19th century townhouses (now-demolished) that once stood on Park Place between Cedar and Gay Streets.
854. This statue, commissioned in 1847 and completed in 1852,  commemorated Jackson's victory over the British at the Battle of New Orleans. Clark Mills, with help from his enslaved apprentice Phillip Reid, cast the piece in ten sections. The White House Historical Association states that it was first bronze statue cast in the United States and the first two legged equestrian statue in the world. The statue outside the Tennessee State Capitol was erected in 1880. Exact replicas stand in Jackson Square in New Orleans and at the White House.
855. Bust portrait of John Coffee, engraved by E. G. Williams & Bro. A facsimile of his signature appears below the portrait.
856. John Coffee was one of Andrew Jackson's closest friends. He served under him as general in the War of 1812, both during the Creek campaigns and at the Battle of New Orleans. They were associates in business and land ventures. Coffee, a large man, backed up Jackson in a number of his physical affrays. Coffee also served as surveyor-general for the Mississippi Territory, later Alabama, from 1817 until his death in 1833.
857. John Overton was perhaps Jackson's closest advisor and confidante. He often wrote to Overton, discussing Washington politics, local and national affairs, gossip, and land speculation. He served as federal tax collector on the whiskey tax from 1796 until 1803. Overton was elected to replace Jackson as judge of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, where he served until 1810. He and Jackson were partners in land speculation and co-founded the city of Memphis. Overton lived at his plantation near Nashville, Traveller's Rest.
858. Photograph of a portrait of John Overton by Ralph Earl. A pair of quills and books appear in the background, emphasizing Overton's intellectual gifts. Original is owned by Travellers Rest Plantation & Museum in Nashville.
859. Alfred Jackson, formerly  enslaved by Jackson, sitting in a rocking chair in his red cedar log cabin (built 1841) at The Hermitage. A quilt is visible on the large four poster bed, which may have come from the mansion.
860. Alfred's mother Betty (1793-1870) was enslaved as the Jacksons' cook; his uncle George was Jackson's personal servant and later the family carriage driver. Alfred assisted with the horses, maintained the wagons and farm equipment, and after emancipation was a tenant farmer at The Hermitage. He lived at the Hermitage longer than anyone white or black, serving as a handyman and tour guide for the Ladies Hermitage Association after the house became a museum. He lived at The Hermitage until his death and is buried near Andrew and Rachel Jackson in the garden.
861. James Winchester (1752-1826) was, like Andrew Jackson, a general officer from Tennessee in the War of 1812 (after having been twice captured during the Revolutionary War). His military reputation suffered after an 1813 defeat and ensuing massacre at the River Raisin in Michigan; Jackson restored him to command at Mobile just before the British invasion of the Gulflands. After the war, the two were business partners, most notably in being the first real owners of the land on which Memphis was founded.
862. Photograph of a waist-up portrait of General James Winchester by Rembrandt Peale, painted in the year before his death. He wears a dark coat and white collar and necktie. He holds a paper in his hand. Image is a copy of the original stored at the Tennessee State Museum.
863. Printed copy on silk of President Andrew Jackson's speech given on December 10, 1832, in opposition to South Carolina's  actions in an attempt to nullify Federal tariffs. Taking his case directly to the American people, Jackson gave constitutional defenses for his actions as president. Dispute over the tariff, which came to a head in the Nullification Crisis, was very much a sectional issue between the industrial North and slaveholding South. It presaged the growing antagonism that would lead eventually to secession and Civil War. South Carolina's challenge to Federal authority in 1832 was beaten back by the strong Unionism of Jackson and other Southern moderates. Such unionists would become a dying breed in the South during the ensuing 30 years.
864. The Nullification Crisis was a confrontation between the federal government and South Carolina over tariffs, South Carolina's perceived rights, and the threat of secession. It began with the passage of the Tariff of 1828, referred to by the South Carolinians as the "Tariff of Abominations." They argued that the tariff protected manufacturing rather than agriculture. Jackson's election as president was expected to ease the tensions, but Jackson refused to lower the tariff until national debts were repaid. After the passage of the Tariff of 1832,  Jackson issued the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina denouncing the nullification doctrine. In the following session, the Force Bill was introduced to Congress, which authorized the use of force to ensure that South Carolina would comply with federal tariffs. This led to the introduction of the Compromise Tariff of 1833. The passage of these two bills eased the rising tensions and ultimately ended the crisis.
865. Jackson's veto of the re-charter of the Bank of the United States was perhaps his most controversial. The bank's recharter passed Congress on July 3, 1832 , which Jackson vetoed on July 10. With his veto, Jackson delivered an address to Congress, that outlined his views on the bank as part of the executive branch, and therefore subject to his orders. On July 13, the veto was sustained as the senate was unable to produce enough votes to override. The bank became an important topic in the 1832 campaign, but Jackson's supporters were able to successfully steer the debate to a decision between Jackson and "the people" against Nicholas Biddle, the bank, and "the aristocracy." After the removal of federal deposits from the Bank, Congress censured Jackson for violating the Constitution. The bank's charter officially expired in 1836.
866. Political cartoon depicting Andrew Jackson as a despotic monarch. He tramples on the Constitution and the coat of arms of Pennsylvania, the location of the United States Bank. A book titled the Judiciary of the United States appears to be thrown aside. In his hand Jackson holds a veto, referring to Jackson's veto of the Bank's rechartering. The text links him with William IV, the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. A classic of Jacksonian era political propaganda, this broadside illustrates the popular sentiments ("Shall he reign over us, or shall the PEOPLE RULE?") that led to the formation of the anti-Jackson Whig Party in Jackson's own backyard.
867. This letter is a response from Andrew Jackson to Governor John Sevier challenging him to a duel. According to the letter, Sevier spoke disparagingly of Jackson's wife Rachel, who had married Jackson before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson wrote, "... In the town of Knoxville did you take the name of a lady into your polluted lips... and now sir in the Neighborhood of Knoxville you shall atone for it or I will publish you as a coward and a poltroon." This letter is part of a larger exchange between Jackson and Sevier, who wrote his own duel challenge to Jackson and accused him of trying to run away.
868. In 1819, Edward Anthony was born in New York City. After graduating from Columbia, he studied the daguerreotype process under Samuel Morse. In the 1860s he and his brother, H. T. opened a portrait gallery in New York City. Anthony died in 1888. (Gilbert, Jacqueline, International Center of Photography)  	Matthew Brady was born in Ireland and immigrated to the United States in 1838. He studied the daguerreotype process under Samuel Morse before striking out on his own. He opened a studio to exhibit his portraits of American politicians and other celebrities. He is perhaps most well-known for his photographic documentation of the Civil War, which left him mired in debt for the remainder of his life.
869. This portrait of Andrew Jackson was most likely taken by Edward Anthony in 1844 or 1845, just months before Jackson's death. Anthony traveled to the Hermitage to photograph the former president in a series of daguerreotypes. Matthew Brady copied Anthony's daguerreotype and displayed it in his New York Studio, popularizing the image. This particular copy was distributed at a later date by Anthony's company, E. & H. T. Anthony & Co.
870. Bond of marriage between Andrew Jackson and Rachel Donelson, alias Rachel Roberts [Robards]. Signed by Andrew Jackson, his bondsmen Robert Hays and John Overton, and witnessed by Andrew Ewing. Dated 17 January 1794.
871. Jackson's appointment to Judge of the Superior Court of Law and Equity for the Hamilton District. The document is signed by Governor John Sevier and his Secretary of State, William Maclin.
872. John Sevier appointed Jackson to Superior Court judge to replace Howell Tatum, who had just resigned. Jackson held this post until his resignation in 1804. Hamilton District, one of Tennessee's five superior court districts, held court in Knoxville, and served the middle portion of East Tennessee. These Superior courts were the forerunners of Tennessee's appellate and Supreme courts.
873. This letter, while undated, appears to be after Burr's travels in the Ohio Valley but prior to his journey to the Louisiana territory. Burr stayed at the Hermitage as a guest of Jackson's in 1805 before meeting his co-conspirator General James Wilkinson at Fort Massac and continuing on to New Orleans, which he referenced in the letter. Later in 1805, Wilkinson accused Burr of treason for conspiring with the Spanish to carve out an independent nation from the American West. The former vice-president was arrested in 1806 in Mississippi Territory by Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Burr was later tried and found not guilty. Jackson testified at his trial.
874. Undated letter from Aaron Burr to Andrew Jackson at the Hermitage in Nashville, asking Jackson to take charge of his carriages, horses, and driver during his absence on a trip south to New Orleans.
875. Senator Felix Grundy wrote President Andrew Jackson regarding Grundy's opposition to nullification and South Carolina's threat to secede. The letter includes a copy of Jackson's response of May 13. Jackson congratulated Grundy that his conduct "in opposition to the absurd and wicked doctrine of nullification" had been "highly useful and energetic."
876. Regarding their prospective duel, Gov. Sevier responded to Jackson's request to meet him near the Indian boundary line to answer for Sevier's apparent insults toward Jackson. Sevier wrote, "Your letter of this day is before me and I am happy...upon the time and place of rendezvous."
877. Regarding their prospective duel, Gov. Sevier responded to Jackson's letter of October 9 with, "I have heard after all your gasconading conduct that you are preparing to leave town within a day or two." Sevier claimed that Jackson still had not named a place outside of the state for them to "have a personal interview," a euphemism for dueling, which was illegal in Tennessee. Somewhat less clear is the soon-to-be-archaic term "gasconading," apparently a reference to the propensity for boastfulness among the people of Gascony. Sevier was, after all, a man of the eighteenth century.
878. Dr. James Armstrong wrote James Winchester from Pensacola to warn him that the British flotilla, commanded by Admiral Alexander Cochrane, was anchored near Pensacola and planned to attack New Orleans. He revealed that his source was an American prisoner who had been kept on board a British warship for 5 months. He claimed to have heard the British officers "boast that they will eat their Christmas dinner in Orleans." Armstrong ended his letter by mentioning the he knows "Gen. Jackson, Gen. Coffee, and most of officers from Tennessee." A note confirming the accuracy of the report is written and signed by William Smith Richards, who wrote a letter to Jackson the same day from Pensacola relaying the same information. That letter is stored at the Library of Congress.
879. Aaron Burr stayed at the Hermitage as Jackson's guest in 1805 before meeting his co-conspirator General James Wilkinson at Fort Massac and continuing on to New Orleans. Later in 1805, Wilkinson accused Burr of treason, who was arrested in 1806, in Mississippi Territory by Edmund Pendleton Gaines. Burr was tried and found not guilty. Jackson testified at his trial.
880. Written in the context of Jackson's coterie of close supporters rallying to his defense during the 1828 electoral campaign, Overton informed Coffee that "the Nashville committee" was "collecting evidence in vindication of General Jackson in relation to the Burr conspiracy." Overton revealed that William L. Brown and William B. Lewis, two committee members, were of the same opinion as him. The style of the 1820s campaigns was such that each side's supporters would launch published and often personal attacks on their man's rivals; in Jackson's case, the "Nashville committee" would then formulate and distribute their rebuttals, often through the means of such correspondence. Overton requested that Coffee make haste to join them.
881. Andrew Jackson's orders of March 5, 1815, clarifying his orders of February 28, 1815. Jackson had ordered all French subjects to "repair" to central Louisiana to prevent them from aiding the British. This was apparently misconstrued and applied to the Louisiana militia that fought alongside Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans. While praising the "French inhabitants of Louisiana" who had "distinguished [themselves] as brave soldiers," Jackson also suggested that traitorous elements had misconstrued his earlier directive and ordered his officers to report all mutinous actions. A French translation was printed alongside the English.
882. Following his success in the Creek Wars, Major General Andrew Jackson was appointed commander of the seventh military district, replacing General Thomas Flournoy. This military district contained Tennessee, Louisiana, and the Mississippi Territory. These military districts were abolished on May 17, 1815, after the conclusion of the War of 1812.
883. In 1798, Governor John Sevier appointed Jackson judge of the Superior Court of Law and Equity. He served in this capacity until 1804.
884. Land indenture or conveyance between grantor Annanias McCoy and grantee Samuel Houston for 300 acres of land in Knox County, on the north side of the Clinch River. Houston paid 200 dollars  for this tract. Jackson, as judge, certified the document. The grantee appears to be Sam Houston's father or perhaps another relation.
885. In this single page letter to Colonel William Moore, Jackson briefly recounts the discovery of Lyncoya, following the Battle of Tallushatchee [Jackson writes Tallahassee], "suckling his dead mother's breast." He mentions the Creek child being sent to him by General Coffee. Jackson then refers to another "wounded" Creek child whom Moore had "brought into camp" to be treated and later raised by Doctor [John] Shelby. This latter child, according to Jackson, "turned out badly" and "ran away from the Doctor."
886. Lincoyer[also written Lyncoya, or Lincoya], a Creek child, was found on the battlefield at Tallushatchee, lying next to his slain mother. Jackson took in the child and raised him alongside his own adopted son Andrew Jackson Jr. Lincoyer died of tuberculosis in 1828
887. Pinckney ordered Jackson to build a series of "posts" or forts connecting Tennessee and Georgia with the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa Rivers and down the Alabama River to Mobile on the Gulf coast. This was to put the Southern country in a "good state of defence." Once Jackson had completed that and "dispersed the enemy at Kahaba [Cahaba]," Pinckney writes, he was free to discharge his troops.
888. Thomas Pinckney was a Revolutionary War veteran, South Carolina state legislator, South Carolina governor, United States Ambassador to Great Britain, United States representative from South Carolina, and major general during the War of 1812, commanding the 6th military district. While a member of the United States House of Representatives, Pinckney was appointed to help conduct the impeachment proceedings against William Blount.
889. Though not signed, presumed to be British General Edward Pakenham's orders for the Battle of New Orleans, "captured from him." These instructions appear to relate to the left side of the British assault ("Maj. Genl. Keane's left"). Pakenham explained that "This flank battn[battalion] will carry the action on the batary[sic] on the right of the enemy's line..." He continued, "When the position is correct the flank battn. to press the enemy's rear 1/2 a mile." Verso reads "British plans of carrying the American breastwork near New Orleans. Jan 8th, 1815." This document was found among the Tennessee General Assembly's legislative records and hence may have been given by a Tennessee officer to the legislature as a trophy from the battle. Not likely to have been taken from the mortally wounded Packenham, who was carried off the field to a place behind British lines, it may have taken off the body of one of his officers or simply picked up from the battlefield.
890. The extra edition of the Nashville Gazette, penned by "Truth," refuted a pamphlet written by Jesse Benton. Benton, brother of Thomas Hart Benton and old personal foe of Jackson's, had written a tract that contained 34 personal attacks on General Andrew Jackson during the 1824 presidential election. In the manner of 1820s political campaigning, the response of Jackson's supporter attempted to clarify the "falsehoods" contained in Benton's pamphlet.  Many of the allegations resulted from Jackson's draconian treatment of militiamen during the Creek campaigns or questionable land transactions.
891. Colonel John Coffee's ration book for his volunteer cavalry that detailed each company under his command and their rations each day. The book began at cantonment Washington, and followed the regiment to Camp Jackson. At the end of the book is an unrelated schedule of cotton picked from September to December 1822 and 1823 at Coffee's plantation of Hickory Hill in northern Alabama. It names 25 of his slaves and the cotton picked each day for the months of September, October, November, and December.  Account details for various business associates were also included.
892. Quartermaster account book of William B. Lewis during the War of 1812, recording accounts payable "for transportation, repairs, quarters and other contingent expenses." Lewis, a close friend and political associate of Jackson, served as quartermaster of accounts for Tennesseans who contributed goods or services to the war effort--particularly and primarily during the Creek campaigns. The book spans from January 7, 1813, to June 30, 1815 and records the amount of payments being made to individuals for all manner of service from lodging to linens to providing provisions, animals and wagons. Famous Tennesseans such as John McNairy, John Rains, Samuel Polk, Samuel Crockett, James Robertson, Felix Robertson, David McGavock, and Duncan Robertson were all reimbursed for contributions in Nashville. Many Native American troops are mentioned in the records, often for foraging for either food or horses, use of their ferry, acting as interpreters, or work as runners and rangers. These include John Ross, Levi Colbert, James Brown, George Wolf, Thelockta, Madwolf, John, and Sam. John Coffee, William Carroll, and Andrew Jackson are reimbursed many times for money fronted by them to pay, equip and feed their troops. Jackson has an entry on June 12, 1815, for $25,000 "for the use of New Orleans Bank." Governor Willie Blount was repaid $1000 on June 12, 1815.
893. This volume, reproduced here in full, is a fascinating and revealing look at how the War of 1812 is conducted by the State of Tennessee. Following the disbursement of funds for the war effort gives insight into the many different individuals--civilian and military, including native Americans--who provided logistical support necessary to maintain a sizable militia army in the field for months. William Berkeley Lewis was a longtime friend and associate of Andrew Jackson. He was appointed quartermaster under Jackson during the War of 1812 and assisted Jackson's 1823 campaign for the Senate and presidential campaigns. Once president, Jackson appointed Lewis second auditor of the treasury.

961. Robert H. Cartmell was a Madison County, Tennessee farmer.
962. This is volume two of a thirty-three volume set of diaries written by Robert H. Cartmell, covering the dates of January 1859-May 1863. Throughout this diary, he writes frequently of the weather and other factors that impact the management of his farm such as the cholera that impacted his hog population in 1859. He also writes in detail of news of the events surrounding the Civil War, including the election of Abraham Lincoln, the secession of Tennessee and other states, and the response to the war by Tennesseans. As the war progresses, he regularly reports on the information that he receives from newspapers about events within the state and throughout the country. Through it all, he continues to farm.
963. This is volume one of a thirty-three volume set of diaries written by Robert H. Cartmell, covering the dates of September 30, 1849- September 30, 1858. The earliest diary entries cover the period when Robert Cartmell was farming with his father, Martin Cartmell, and contain records on the amounts of corn and cotton raised. In 1853, when Cartmell becomes a landowner, his entries contain information about the management of a farm, the weather, the fluctuations of the cotton market, and the roles of slaves in this business enterprise. They also contain thoughtful comments on politics, candidates for office, and and opinions on matters of public interest including the price of cotton, slavery, abolition, railroads, agricultural meetings, state fairs, prohibition, religion, secession, The Union, and the conditions in Madison County during and after the Civil War.
964. Commissary building, theatre, and YMCA at the Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant on Donelson Ave. and Elliston Street. There is a sign on the side of the theater which reads: "united war work campaign scores".
965. The Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant had numerous community facilities for workers, many of which were segregated according to race, including schools, churches, banks, theatres, hotels, YMCAs, hotels, commissary stores, and mess halls. In August 1918 over one million meals were served to workers over the course of the month.
966. DuPont recruited tens of thousands of domestic and international workers in order to build and operate the Old Hickory Gunpowder plant. Many of these workers lived on-site in temporary and permanent housing, which was segregated according to race and gender. Laborers and low-skilled workers lived in the temporary village west of Hadley Avenue, company employees and high-skilled workers lived in the permanent village east of Hadley Avenue, Mexican workers lived in the 'Mexican village' to the north of the plant, and African Americans lived west of Hadley Avenue 'along ninth and tenth streets.'

971. DuPont built and operated the Old Hickory gunpowder plant, under contract for the United States government, to manufacture smokeless gunpowder for the Allied war effort. The War Department of the Federal government paid all construction costs, which amounted to approximately $83,000,000, and DuPont received $1 in compensation. The plant was located at a bend in the Cumberland River near Nashville, Tennessee, and was 93% completed by the time of the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The Old Hickory Gunpowder plant was the largest munitions plant in the world at the time of operation, 1918-1919, occupying 4,700 acres and producing half a million pounds of powder a day.

980. DuPont ceased production at the Old Hickory Gunpowder plant two months after the Armistice of 11 November 1918. The Nashville Industrial Corporation acquired the plant in 1920 for around $3,500,000; a deal which saw Ernest C. Morse, director of sales for the War Department, "indicted by a grand jury for fraud." In 1923 The Nashville Industrial Corporation sold the plant back to DuPont who would use it to manufacture rayon and cellophane. DuPont ceased the production of rayon in 1961 and the production of cellophane in 1964 after decades of profitability and success.
981. One of the benefits for workers at the Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant was the schooling facilities. The schools were 250 feet by 350 feet and segregated according to race. Children were taught during the day while adults had the opportunity to take classes in the evenings. DuPont boasted that one schoolhouse was constructed, from start to finish, in ten days.
982. School on Hadley and Robertson roads at the Old Hickory DuPont Gunpowder plant. The sign on the school reads "United War Work Campaign November 11th to the 18th."

1029. Railroads were a major contributing factor in altering the population in the South. Cheap and easy transportation, railroads allowed many African Americans to move out of the South and many whites to move into it. The railroads and immigration agencies made organized efforts to supply white labor, which was increasingly in demand. The ratio of white population increased in the Southern States through births and white immigration. Later, efforts were made at limiting railroad access for African Americans in order to stem migration.

In the summer of 1946, after World War II had ended, a Joint Army Navy task force conducted the largest American nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Known as Operation Crossroads, the purpose of these tests was to determine how effective nuclear bombs would be against navy ships. Two tests, known as ABLE and BAKER were conducted. Navy Vice Admiral William H.P. Blandy led the operation. Ninety-five decommissioned ships were present and live animals were placed on these ships to determine how the bombs would impact living creatures. They were the first tests publicly announced and observed by an audience, which included a large press contingent. Operations Crossroads ended on August 10, 1946 due to concerns about radiation. However, the United States would go on to test nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands until 1958.

Men from the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) played a significant role in creating the park. They built hiking trails and fire watchtowers and improved infrastructure. Not all Tennesseans were happy about the park. Bit by bit the federal government purchased the land from farmers and mountaineers--often at less than acceptable prices--who were evicted.

1191. In all, Tennessee contributed four regiments (more than 4,200 men) to the Spanish-American War. Just one, the First Tennessee Infantry, saw combat, and that was in the Philippine Insurrection. The First Tennessee was disbanded in November 1899, but almost a third of its men joined the 37th U.S. Infantry, which became popularly known as the "Tennessee Brigade." The Second Tennessee, raised mostly from men in West Tennessee, trained for war but never saw combat. They were discharged in February 1899.

1193. Secretary of State John Hay called it "a splendid little war," and its outcome was never in doubt. U.S. forces would ultimately crush the Spanish, ending an empire that had begun with the discovery of America four centuries earlier. Complete victory over Spain signaled the emergence of the United States as a major player in international affairs. The fighting in Cuba lasted about four months during the spring and summer of 1898. The conflict in the Philippines, however, would prove more troublesome . and cause more soul-searching. The fighting took place simultaneously in two theaters, Cuba and the Philippines. As the war broke out, Spain was attempting to suppress popular rebellions in both colonies. Stories of Spanish cruelty toward the Cubans were widely published, and newspapers did not hesitate to use propaganda to incite their readers. The term "concentration camps" originated during this period, arising from the reconcentrados (prison camps) the Spanish military had been using in Cuba. The case for war was advanced in part by the sinking of the USS Maine, an armored cruiser sent to Havana Harbor to protect American interests during the Cuban uprising. On February 15 an enormous explosion ripped apart the hull of the Maine, killing 266 sailors. The New York press, in a fit of jingoism, attributed the blast to Spanish sabotage and whipped up a ferocious war fever among readers. "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!" became the rallying cry of those eager for war. Such sensationalism sold millions of newspapers. Some historians believe this "yellow journalism" helped precipitate war with Spain.

1203. By December 1813, after the victories won by the Tennessee Volunteer armies at the Battle of Talladega in November 1813, General Andrew Jackson faced a mutiny by his volunteers regarding their enlistment periods. The problem originated with troops having volunteered for a one-year period at the time of The Natchez Expedition. Jackson felt that time not spent in the field should not apply to the year's enlistment, but the volunteers felt otherwise, insisting that the enlistment period should include all time spent away from home. The conflict evolved into hostilities and ended with courts-martial for a considerable number of men. By the time Jackson received 900 raw recruits on January 14, 1814, he was down to a force of 103 men. Jackson fought the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek a week later on January 22-24, 1814.

Women took important jobs in such factories as the Vultee Aircraft Plant in Nashville, where approximately one-third of the wartime employees were women. This plant built O-49 observation planes, A-35 Vengeance dive bombers, and P-38 Lightning fighters. Any woman who worked in the factories was soon dubbed "Rosie the Riveter" after a popular cartoon figure.

1221. In September 1833, President Andrew Jackson made a now infamous decision to remove federal deposits from the Second Bank of the United States, a privately chartered institution. Jackson was afraid that the bank would eventually become too powerful, since the federal government gave the bank the right of not only controlling federal funds, but printing money as well. Even those who shared Jackson's concern about the growing monopoly of the bank feared that completely removing the funds, especially all at once, would create a panic and hurt the general public. They also believed Jackson was abusing his office.  William J. Duane, the Secretary of the Treasury, who was dismissed by Jackson, was one of these men. In 1834, the Senate censured Jackson for assuming powers not conferred by the Constitution. In 1837, as Jackson was ailing, the Senate expunged the censure.

1230. Born in Mississippi, Ida Bell Wells was an early leader of the movements for civil and women’s rights. In 1878, Wells lost both her parents to the yellow fever epidemic that struck the Memphis/Northern Mississippi area. She attended Rust College and became a teacher in the Shelby County school system. 

In September 1883, Wells purchased a first class train ticket to take her from Memphis to Woodstock, TN. After boarding the train, Wells was asked by a train conductor to move from the ladies car to the smoking car, which was crowded with passengers.  She resisted and was forcibly removed from the train car. 

Wells filed suit in 1884 against the Chesapeake, Ohio & Southwestern Railroad Company and hired Thomas F. Cassels as her attorney. Cassels had represented Shelby County in the Tennessee General Assembly from 1881-1883, but she soon fired him when he dropped the suit, believing he had been “bought off” by the railroad company. Next, she hired James M. Greer, a former Union Officer, as her attorney.  Greer won the case in circuit court arguing that the company had violated two Tennessee statutes: one that prohibited railroads from charging blacks first-class fare and then seating them in second-class cars; the second statute required “separate but equal” accommodations for blacks and whites. On December 24, 1884, Wells was awarded $500 in damages in the Circuit Court of Shelby County. The Circuit Court’s opinion was overturned, however, by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1887. It is important to note that this is taking place before the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision that established the “separate but equal” doctrine and constitutionalized racial segregation. Wells was a strong opponent of the segregation of public facilities and would eventually leave Memphis for Chicago where she continued fighting for the rights of women and African Americans.

The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict-lease program that began in 1866.

1318. Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color. Several treatments were proposed for yellow fever by physicians and medical journals of the day. One recommendation was the use of �concussion� to kill the parasite causing yellow fever. Believing the disease was contagious, they thought that shooting cannons into the atmosphere would create a �concussion� that would kill the parasite causing yellow fever. Ultimately, yellow fever only ended in a community when a hard freeze killed the mosquitos transmitting the disease.
1319. The United States spent more than $300 billion supporting World War II by fighting the Axis powers and supplying our Allies. To fund this war, the United States Treasury issued war bonds that were purchased by Americans. The money raised was used to supply soldiers with uniforms, weapons, food and other things the military needed. To encourage citizens to purchase these bonds, the government created propaganda posters to advertise their availability and encourage support for war bonds from the home front.
1320. This World War II era poster features a striking image of a soldier with wounds on his right hand and left leg below the knee. The poster encourages Americans to purchase war bonds reminding them that ""Care is costly.""
1321. This broadside announces rules passed by the Board of Health of Covington, Tenn. for travel into Memphis and return into Covington during the prevalence of yellow fever. The rules state that the trains on the Memphis, Paducah, and Northern Railroad may not go south of the Second Street crossing near Memphis, no personal apparel or other personal goods are allowed to come into Covington from Memphis unless thoroughly disinfected, and no bedding or other household goods were allowed to come into Covington. It concludes with a statement saying ""No quarrantine yet against persons and freight, but will be soon if fever increases"" and is signed by W.N. White, Sec.
1322. Yellow Fever devastated the city of Memphis in the 1870s. In 1873, 2,000 were killed by the disease. When the disease returned in late July 1878, 25,000 residents fled the city. Between August and October of 1878, the disease killed more than 5,000 people. Towns along the railroads leading out of Memphis also experienced significant losses due to the epidemic. Yellow Fever caused fever, chills, hemorrhaging, severe pain, a yellowing of the skin, and vomit that was black in color.
1323. On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company�s stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates. When Governor John P. Buchanan called a special session of the Tennessee State Legislature in August to consider the issue of convict leasing, the legislature resolved to abolish convict leasing once the current contract expired. The miners felt like more could be done. Rebellion continued until the 1893 Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to construct a new state penitentiary and abolish convict leasing in 1896.
1324. This letter from Commanding Captain A.B. Bayless of Company C, First Regiment of the National Guard State of Tennessee, endorses the application of Mr. Robert Quarles for the position of Superintendent of the State Armory.

There are three men and one police officer standing beside the tires holding a sign that reads ""State of Tennessee enters 'Treausure Hunt' for Salvage Rubber"".
1328. Home canning already had a long history in Tennessee. During the World War II period it received new attention. Through the use of posters, the United States government encouraged Americans to start ""victory gardens"" and can produce at home. Victory gardens would reduce reliance on limited food rations and help families put aside for winter. Convincing citizens to can at home also relieved pressure on the canning industry, allowing them to focus on producing food for soldiers and reducing the amount of tin used. Like all other war efforts, home canning and victory gardens brought US citizens together in support of the war effort.
1329. This colorful World War II era poster encourages the American homefront to support the war effort. It features a glass jar with a label on it that reads ""Can All You Can"" in front of a background of fruits and vegetables.
1330. Information Bulletin Number 5 was issued to all county rationing boards in Tennessee and notifies the boards of an amendment to the tire rationing regulations.

It is signed by Lytle Brown, State Rationing Administrator, Tennessee State Defense Council.
1331. This letter from Prentiss Brown, administrator of the Office of Price Administration, commends the members of local War Price and Ration Boards for their untiring effort, excellent judgement, and ability to adjust national policy to local conditions. He states that without their efforts, ""we would long ago have failed in our efforts to control inflation and to maintain the fair distribution of scarce commodities.""
1332. On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN congregated and marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company�s stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates.

1354. This poster from World War I shows a Jewish woman and child sitting among the rubble of a community.
1355. This photograph shows a parade of soldiers who are leaving Jackson, Tennessee for service in World War I. All soldiers are dressed in uniform.
1356. The National Food Administration encouraged Americans to grow and preserve greater amounts of food during the World War I era. The goal was for food consumption on the home front to decrease so that the surplus food production could be used to feed American soldiers overseas. This mobilization took place through home demonstration agencies, which networked with land-grant colleges all across the South. In Tennessee, this mobilization took place through the University of Tennessee County Extension Service agents. The UT Extension Service sponsored local 4-H programs which taught several domestic skills to Tennesseans at home.
1357. This photograph shows a group of women carrying out an operation to can corn, tomatoes, green beans, and more in Oakland, Fayette County, Tennessee. They appear to be canning as part of a 4-H Club, as the cans have the ""4H Brand"" label. The women are dressed similarly, wearing white hats and aprons.
1358. The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 by veterans of the Confederate Army. At its inception, the Klan was initially a social club for young men seeking amusement and entertainment in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted the process of Reconstruction by intimidating ""carpetbaggers"", ""scalawags"", and freedmen. The Klan quickly adopted violent methods and the increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870.
1359. This letter to the editor, appearing in the Nashville Daily Press and Times on March 24, 1868, reports of a murder of an African American man in the southwest corner of Gibson County. The author states that the case has not been investigated and that the freedmen are continually alarmed at the threats being thrown out. He goes on to say ""I am fearful we are approaching trouble of a serious nature.""
1360. This photograph shows a group of five laborers picking cotton in a field in the west Tennessee town of Huntington, Tennessee in Carroll County.
1361. This photograph shows two men with a mule and a plow. One man is wearing a suit, the other man is wearing work clothes, he is likely a sharecropper. A large farm operation appears in the background.
1362. This photograph features a group of men and women picking cotton in Ripley, Tennessee.
1363. This article features a report made by Gen. Kellar Anderson of the Tennessee National Guard of a ""sensational"" incident with prisoner and miner James Muldoon. According to the report, all the miners in the valley had gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the first release of the convicts and General Anderson had issued orders to his men that no one should leave the militia camp. A young man by the name of Wooten was sent from the medical department to a store in the village and was there accosted by several miners, one which took his pistol away, pointed it at him, and made him give up his belt. This man was James Muldoon who was later arrested for the incident. His friends tried to unsuccessfully recapture him and after additional incidents, Muldoon was eventually handed over to a committee of miners who assured Gen. Anderson that he would be properly punished.
1364. This article describes an attempt by miners to release a prisoner held by the Tennessee National Guard at Coal Creek. James Muldoon was arrested for disarming a soldier and 500 armed miners gathered to effect his release. The article reports that Squire Brown of Briceville was intimidated by the crowd and refused to hear the case. Ultimately, the mob disappeared without making further demonstrations.
1365. Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.
1366. This interview was conducted by Lee S. Greene in the process of writing his book, "Lead Me on: Frank Goad Clement and Tennessee Politics." Joe W. Henry served as the adjutant general of Tennessee from January 1953 to January 1959, which encompassed the desegregation of Clinton High School. Henry went on to serve on the Tennessee Supreme Court on September 1, 1974,and then served as the Chief Justice from 1979 until his death in June 1980. This interview with Henry highlights the role of the National Guard stationed in Clinton, Tennessee during the beginning of integration at Clinton High School. Henry also touches on the interaction of townspeople with the desegregation and how the public was involved.
1367. This article records the ongoing problems occurring from the integration of the high school three months after the event. This article mentions the closing of the school for a week in December, resulting from the continuing tension, and the status of the African American students after the school reopened. A particularly emotional quote comes from the father of one of the black students who decides to move his family to California due to the difficulties of integration in the South. This article also includes quotes from Clinton's mayor, Everette Lewallen, and Reverend Turner, famous for walking the African American students to the school on the first day of desegregation.
1368. This letter, written by a Clinton resident, presents a strong opposing view to integration. Johnson's letter shows the opposition to integration: "I think it is bad when 12 Negros can ruin the education of 800 white students." Johnson even mentions the effect integration will have on his own family with the line "I have a son who is a sophomore in Clinton Hi. He don't want to go to school with Negros-I intend to let him make the decision."
1369. This letter comes from the Clerk and Master of Tipton County Chancery Court and gives an opposing view to integration. Boyd believes that integration at Clinton High School will only become more volatile and that the real solution is to cut off public funding for the school and ultimately close it. At the end of his letter, Boyd recommends that the Legislature be called together to enact laws that would  enable us to have continued segregation in Tennessee which is wanted by the people of Tennessee.
1370. This article discusses Clinton's actions to recruit extra policemen to take over after the National Guard were pulled out of Clinton. The article also names the men sworn in as policemen so far at the time of the article's publication.
1371. This article describes the court proceedings leading up to the release of John Kasper. Kasper had been charged with inciting a riot and sedition for his interference with the desegregation of Clinton High School. The charges were dismissed during the court proceedings discussed in this article.
1372. Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) sitting at writing desk. Written on item:  "From the original paiting by Chappel in the possession of the publishers."
1373. Scientist, inventor, statesman, printer, philosopher, musician, and economist.  In 1784, discontent settlers in Colonial North Carolina's western counties formed a separate, independent state and named it  "Franklin." The December 1784 Provisional Constitution of Jonesborough used "Franklin," and the Second Constitutional Convention at Greeneville in November of 1785 fixed the name of the state at the request of John Sevier as "Franklin," in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Sevier sought to curry the favor of Benjamin Franklin for the new state and wrote him a letter revealing the honor and requesting his support. Franklin, in Europe at the time, acknowledged the tribute in a 1787 letter to Sevier, but offered no further recognition. The State of Franklin existed from 1784 to 1788.
1374. Composite image of the three buildings where capitols were located in Tennessee. In the upper left is a drawing of the Capitol for the State of Franklin, in the upper right is an image of the capitol at Knoxville, and in the middle of the page is an image of the current Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville.
1375. Log cabin Capitol building of the State of Franklin in Greeneville, Tennessee.
1376. The State of Franklin was created in 1784.  The first General Assembly of Franklin met in 1785 and elected John Sevier governor. Jonesborough functioned as the provisional capital of the Franklin goverment from August 1784 to December of 1785.  Greeneville became the permanent capital in December of 1785. With the governments of the State of Franklin and that of North Carolina operating simultaneously in the same geographic area during a portion of this period, this Greeneville permanent capitol structure, the proceedings that took place within, and the resulting documents provided validation and stature to the new, independent state. The State of Franklin ceased to exist in 1788.  This original log cabin structure was dismantled to be reassembled in Nashville for the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897.  A replica was eventually constructed at the Greeneville site when the logs were not returned to the city.
1377. Color image of the portrait of John Sevier painted by Charles Wilson Peale in 1790 that is now in the collection of the Tennessee State Museum. This waist-up picture of Sevier in military uniform shows his right hand holding a saber handle.
1378. John Sevier served in the Revolutionary War, was a leader of the Watauga Association, sealed his reputation as a military commander at the Battle of King's Mountain, served as Governor of the State of Franklin, and was elected the first Governor of Tennessee.  Sevier was elected to the U.S. Congress in 1811 and during the War of 1812, chaired the Military Affairs Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.
1379. Governor Cooper responded positively to this letter and was invited to tour the Clinton Engineer Works site on November 3, 1943 with General Leslie R. Groves of the Manhattan Engineering District and Nichols, who had been promoted to the title of District Engineer. By this time, Oak Ridge had become the headquarters of the Manhattan Project.
1380. Letter dated July 31, 1943 to Governor Prentice Cooper from Colonel K. D. Nichols and Lieutenant Colonel R. G. Cornell of the Corps of Engineers. Nichols and Cornell apologize to Governor Cooper for a letter sent by Colonel Thomas T. Crenshaw, Corps of Engineers, which questioned Tennessee's willingness to provide the federal government with the land to build Clinton Engineer Works, also known as Oak Ridge.
1381. After the test at the Trinity site in New Mexico and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, scientists observed that the high radiation levels that were the product of these detonations had severe environmental effects. Likewise, the sites where radioactive materials were produced were impacted. Many post-war studies were conducted to measure negative effects of the production at Clinton Engineer Works on the environment of Oak Ridge and the health of its community.
1382. This photograph shows three scientists using a Geiger counter to measure radiation during an experiment on a cow. The scientists pictured are likely researchers at the Agricultural Research Laboratory at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which was operated for the Atomic Energy Commission by the University of Tennessee after World War II.
1383. Due to labor shortages on the homefront in the United States, women filled many of the growing number of production jobs left open by the military's draft of young men. Parker's anecdote about the production competition between the women employed at Y-12 and the University of California physicists who challenged them displays common attitudes toward women and people from the American South at this time.
1384. Interview of George Parker, nuclear chemist on Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge conducted by Ann Toplovich of the Tennessee Historical Society at his home at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this interview, Parker describes the role of local women from East Tennessee who were employed as technicians at Oak Ridge.
1385. Interview of George Parker, nuclear chemist on Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge conducted by Ann Toplovich of the Tennessee Historical Society at his home at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In this interview, Parker describes the ethical debate scientists and government officials engaged in over use of the atomic bomb, which was sparked by the circulation of The Szilard Petition.
1386. The Szilard Petition (dated July 17, 1945) was signed by Leo Szilard and 69 other scientists in Chicago and Oak Ridge. This petition asked President Truman to demonstrate the power of the bomb to the Japanese before detonation. At Oak Ridge, this document prompted discussion among Clinton Engineer Works scientists about the use of nuclear weapons in warfare. Scientists, including Parker, wrote letters to the president detailing their positions for or against using atomic weapons to end World War II.
1387. Map sent to the Tennessee Civil Aeronautics Administration, which prohibited the flying over of the Oak Ridge area and other former military reservations of the Manhattan Engineer District overseen by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Issued by U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C. Compiled and printed at Washington D.C. by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Prohibited area established by Executive Order 9925, dated January 17, 1948. Danger area established by Civil Aeronautics Administration Regulation 604, dated March 1, 1948.
1388. Some of the former sites of the Manhattan Project were repurposed after World War II for continued nuclear research and weapon development by the Atomic Energy Commission. Oak Ridge, Tennessee was the former site of the Clinton Engineer Works that produced most of the u-235 used in the "Little Boy" atomic bomb, which became Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Hanford, Washington was the former site of the Hanford Engineer Works that produced most of the plutonium used in the Trinity site and "Fat Man" atomic bombs, which continued producing plutonium for defense purposes during the Cold War. Los Alamos, New Mexico was the former site of Project Y where top physicists gathered to develop atomic weapons, which became Los Alamos National Laboratory. Salton Sea, California was the site where aeroballistic tests of inert nuclear weapons were conducted during World War II and the Cold War.
1389. Reprint of letter dated August 8, 1945 from Major General Leslie R. Groves, Manhattan Engineer District, thanking Guy Smith, editor of the The Knoxville Journal, for censoring news about atomic research and the Manhattan Engineering Districts published August 12, 1945.
1390. While most of the workers at Clinton Engineer Works did not know that they were playing a major role in the development of the atomic bomb, many in the newspaper profession had begun to piece together the significance of the top-secret military reservations in Tennessee, Washington, and New Mexico. When Germany surrendered in May of 1945, the government was concerned that reporters might expose the projects or demand more information on the atomic bomb, as there had been speculation and information leaks in the past. To combat the release of any sensitive information, the Office of Censorship mailed confidential letters in May to editors in Tennessee, Washington, and their surrounding states that asked the publications to keep these projects a secret until the end of the war.
1391. Political cartoon by unknown artist that compares humanity's use of the atomic bomb to the Biblical story of the fall of Adam and Eve.
1392. Published two days after the bombing of Hiroshima, this cartoon is representative of the moral and ethical objections to nuclear warfare raised by many people around the world. It also echoes sentiments that humanity had reached a "point of no return" where important aspects of life would be forever altered after the use of nuclear weapons.
1393. This photograph shows the X-10 Pile at Oak Ridge, a graphite-moderated nuclear reactor used to create plutonium-239 from uranium-238 and the neutrons emitted in the fission of uranium-235. On the back of the photo is written: Basic materials for Abbott Laboratories' radiopharmaceuticals are produced in this giant nuclear reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
1394. X-10 was the World War II code name for Clinton Laboratories, which is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The X-10 reactor served as a model for the construction of a larger plutonium production plant in Hanford, Washington, which created the plutonium used in the "Fat Man" atomic bomb detonated over Nagasaki. Here, the reactor is shown being used for one of its peacetime activities before its deactivation in 1963.
1395. This photograph shows the Y-12 electromagnetic isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge used to separate the fissile u-235 isotopes from natural uranium. On the back of the photo is written: Electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, also known as Y-12. Operated for the Atomic Energy Commission by Union Carbide Corporation.
1396. Y-12 was the World War II code name for the electromagnetic isotope separation plant at Oak Ridge. The plant began operations in 1943 using an electromagnetic process developed at the University of California, Berkeley. A large portion of the u-235 used in the "Little Boy" atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was harvested at this site. This site is now known as the Y-12 National Security Complex.
1397. This aerial photograph displays a large portion of the X-10 facilities at Oak Ridge where the uranium isotope u-235 was extracted from u-238. On the back of the photo is written: Oak Ridge National Laboratory, also known as X-10, the world's largest nuclear research center.
1398. X-10 was the World War II code name for Clinton Laboratories, which is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A large portion of the u-235 used in the "Little Boy" atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima was harvested at this site.
1399. ALCOA produced aluminum products used to construct aircrafts. Boys too young to join the military were encouraged to "do their bit" by taking jobs at the plant during school breaks. Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation and Tennessee Eastman Corporation were a part of the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineer Works, which produced materials to construct the atom bomb. The military chose the location of Oak Ridge in part for its remote location and cheap land, but the site's proximity to Knoxville was key, as the plants would require a large, local workforce to employ. The opening of these plants, combined with the draft of a large portion of the young men in the population, meant that many jobs both in Knoxville and Oak Ridge were open to and filled by local women.
1400. Series of classified ads that ran in multiple local East Tennessee publications for World War II production jobs.
1401. K-25 is the World War II code name for the gaseous diffusion plant at Oak Ridge. Construction on the plant began in mid-1943 and was not completed until early 1945. The plant was decontaminated and demolished from 2008 to 2013.
1402. This photograph shows the K-25 plant at Oak Ridge that separated u-235 from u-238 using the gaseous diffusion method. The facility covered more than 1,500 acres and, at that time, was the largest building under one roof in the world. Note that the buildings have few windows except on the top floor.
1403. Construction for Fontana Dam began in 1942 and was completed in 1944. It is the tallest dam in the Eastern United States at a height of 480 feet, and it was the fourth tallest dam in the world at its time of completion.
1404. This photograph shows the Fontana Dam, which was built in North Carolina off of the Little Tennessee River by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to power the aluminum factories of ALCOA and the plants of the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge during World War II.
1405. Many talented scientists in the United States were relocated from their homes and universities to work on the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge. These scientists often brought their families with them or married and began families on the military reservation. The accommodations for these high-ranking members of this community were called "cemestos" due to the composition of their building material, cement and asbestos. Single workers on the project often lived in sex segregated dormitories. Others lived in temporary trailers when space ran out in cemestos and dormitories. African American workers lived in significantly worse conditions, segregated by race and sex, even for married couples. The "huntment" structures that they were housed in had no heat or air conditioning and were called hovels by newspapers of the period.
1406. This photograph shows a couple embracing with an Oak Ridge neighborhood in the background.
1407. In the 1920s, many American homes began to have electricity for the first time. With the introduction of electricity, many products began to be developed that saved people time from their housework and chores. As a result, many people began to eagerly purchase these new electrical appliances in the hopes of having more leisure time. To encourage rural people to want to have electricity in their homes, many electric power companies held demonstrations and offered promotional booklets that illustrated the benefits of having electricity on the farm.
1408. Promotional booklet developed by the Tennessee Electric Power Company to tell rural customers about the benefits of having electricity and electrical appliances on the farm. This booklet addresses refrigeration, cooking, heating water, and other types of appliances.
1409. A small,�early map of the Old Stone Fort site,with labels and legend in Swedish, drawn by Swedish aristocrat Alex Klinkowstrom during his visit to America, 1818-1820. The map is actually a page from an atlas of lithographs illustrating American building and scenes.
1410. Archaeologists currently describe the Old Stone Fort site as a ""ceremonial enclosure"" constructed by Native Americans of the Woodland culture over a period of some 200 years between 100 C. E. and 500 C.E. This map appears to be the earliest rendering of the site in our collection.
1411. This interview was conducted by Lee S. Greene in the process of writing his book, "Lead Me on: Frank Goad Clement and Tennessee Politics."This interview with Horace Wells, editor of a local Clinton, Tennessee newspaper, describes the integration of Clinton High School. Wells discusses the actual desegregation itself, along with interactions of various people involved and the impact on the town of Clinton.
1412. Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the ""Clinton 12."" During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.
1413. This article discusses the Anderson County school board's petition to the Federal Government for help to enforce the Federal Court integration order.The school board requests protection of African American students going to school, and for help stopping whites from harassing black students. The article includes the board's entire petition, along with a picture of the school board, principle of Clinton High School and county superintendent, and a photo of white students ready to hassle black students.
1414. This interview was conducted by Lee S. Greene in the process of writing his book, ""Lead Me on: Frank Goad Clement and Tennessee Politics."" This interview with Buford Lewallen, son of W.E. Lewallen (the mayor of Clinton at the time of the desegregation of the high school), highlights his father's involvement in the Clinton High School desegregation. Lewallen specifically discusses the change in violence among the Clinton town members.
1415. This letter is from Mr. and Mrs. Byrn, white Tennessee residents, who support both Clement's decision to send the National Guard to Clinton, TN and desegregation as a whole. Mrs. Byrn includes an inspiring story of her conversation with some neighbor children concerning school integration. One particularly impactful quote comes from one of the boys: They [African American children] have as much right to an education as I have, and I would do nothing to keep them from going to our school and would help them all I could.
1416. This letter is from Helen E. Lumpkins, an African American woman living in the north who supports integration. Throughout the letter Lumpkin praises Clement on his actions in Tennessee regarding integration. Lumpkin also emphasizes the need for more actions like those of Clement's to alleviate the tensions between blacks and whites.
1417. This letter from Lewallen, mayor of Clinton during the desegregation of the high school, gives some details concerning the rioting that occurred in the days surrounding the desegregation event. This letter gives a point of view of someone directly involved in the events in Clinton, and Lewallen also applauds Clement's actions in dispatching the National Guard to Clinton.
1418. This letter, from Minnesotan Mrs. Frederick L. Renaud, supports integration. Renaud points out the importance of Clinton to the rest of the country in the context of desegregation as a whole and also communicates her support for the education of African Americans and desegregation in general.
1419. This letter is from Alice Rhyne, a citizen from Clinton opposing integration. The letter is very short with only a brief condemnation of Clement's actions towards integration. However, what is really of interest is a copy of a song written about the integration in Clinton that is included with this letter. Titled the "Clinton Ballad", this song presents a critical view of the actions of the federal government, local Anderson County judiciary, John Kasper, Clement, and the citizens of Clinton during integration of the school. Also included in this letter is an illustration titled "I Aided Integration" and depicts three white men: a National Guardsman, one that is presumably Governor Clement, and an unknown white man. The National Guardsman is holding a small African American boy and standing on top of a white woman's body. The woman is wearing a ribbon labeled "Majority Rule".
1420. This letter is from Frederick Smith, a Tennessee resident living in Munford,Tennessee. Smith indicates that he opposes integration and believes the true feelings of Tennesseans are for continued segregation and Clement's actions regarding Clinton were for political gain. Smith believes that Tennesseans should be allowed to resist the racial changes occurring. Smith writes Clement: "you should realize that this integration problem is being forced upon the entire South, including Tennessee, and the only way the Southerners can fight back is through demonstrations and a mild form of firm resistance. While he does think order is important, Smith also believes in the will of the people being the majority rule.
1421. This headline article, appearing in the Clinton Courier-News, discusses the court order brought against John Kasper and others who protested the school integration in Clinton. This article outlines Kasper's action of protest in a story form, and also includes a photo of Kasper.
1422. This article takes a closer look at Kasper's interference in the Clinton situation and citizen reaction to this interference. This article includes positions of students involved and has some wonderful pictures of protesters and of crowds listening to Kasper.
1423. "This headline article highlights the court proceedings leading up to the integration of Clinton High School. As stated in the article’s title, a bill was filed in the Chancery Court of Anderson County to prevent state funding for Clinton High School as long as black students are allowed to enroll. The bill listed several Clinton citizens as complainants, although many of these people are quoted in the article as saying they had no idea of legal action being taken. The bill alleges that the integration decree given by the U.S. District Court of Eastern Tennessee violates the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The bill also asks that D.J. Brittain, Jr., principal of Clinton High School, be restrained from allowing and/or forcing black students to attend Clinton High School and that any such integration would be ruled unconstitutional.  

"
1424. Clinton High School, located in Clinton, Tennessee in Anderson County, was the first school in the state to be integrated in 1956 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. There were twelve African-American students who enrolled in the school in the fall of 1956, and they became known as the "Clinton 12." During the integration in the fall of 1956, Clinton was the site of anti-integration riots and protests, including the involvement of notorious white supremacist John Kasper. After the violence escalated on September 1, the National Guard was called into Clinton to keep the peace and protect citizens.
1425. This article focuses on the students, the majority of which went along with their normal school routines in the face of the protests. The article does, however, does mention the students who protested integration.
1426. This article describes the National Guard involvement in the town of Clinton, mainly during Labor Day weekend in 1956. Beginning with a recap of the events leading up to the National Guard being sent to Clinton, this article gives details about the National Guard's role in keeping order in the town. This article also discusses the aftermath of the rioting that occured on Labor Day weekend, both in the town itself and at the school. This title feature of this article, however, refers to a short blurb about John Kasper and his court sentence of one year for violating a court order prohibiting interference with the integration of Clinton High School.
1427. This article records the statement of Mayor W.E. Lewallen regarding desegregation. Lewallen urges Clinton citizens to obey the desegregation laws. "While every American has the perfect right to differ in his opinions," Lewallen states in a part of his statement, "none of us has the right to violate the law."
1428. This short article discusses "Operation Law and Order" that consisted of the National Guard being posted in Clinton to aid in peacekeeping during the unrest following the desegregation of Clinton High School.
1429. This page title shows several photos relating to the protests and National Guard action during the integration of Clinton High School. While light on text, this section includes photos of Guardsmen and segregationists.
1430. This editorial written by Clinton Courier-News editor H.V. Wells, Jr. provides an insider's perspective on the integration of Clinton High School. Wells' main point is that, although each citizen has a right to be for or against integration, he or she must still obey the law. In addition, Wells mentions the National Guard's presense and involvement in the town and his apprecation for their service. Also, Wells discusses the media's portrayal of Clinton and clarifies that, "contrary to some reports, Clinton High School IS operating on regular schedule."
1431. This article describes John Kasper's hearing for bond. This hearing came after he was given a one year prison sentence for violating a court order prohibiting actions that would interfere with the integration of Clinton High School.
1432. This article describes John Kasper's speech, given during the Clinton riots. In his speech, Kasper criticizes city and county officials and school officials.

1434. This article discusses Clinton after the riots and protesting concerning Clinton High School that occured over Labor Day weekend 1956. In particular, this article focuses on efforts made by the Clinton police department to continue the law and order put in place by the National Guard who were stationed in the town over the weekend. Also, this article looks at the fluctuation in student enrollment at the high school that occured during the time of desegregation and its aftermath.
1435. Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note are the two printed letters from Colonel K. D. Nichols, District Engineer of the Manhattan Project. In these letters, he congratulates workers on their contributions to the production of the atomic bomb. These letters also reveal the sense of unease felt during the last days of World War II, as Nichols emphasizes that workers must continue to produce materials for an unknown number of atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan and for future defense purposes during peacetime.
1436. This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published four days after the bombing of Nagasaki. Following the news releases about the Manhattan Project and atomic energy, security measures were tightened, and workers were reminded to be wary of spies.
1437. Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note are the "Whereishima?" joke and the "Kill that Rumor" cartoon found on page three. These features are representative of the culture of the city of Oak Ridge and other parts of the United States where propaganda devices, such as posters, were prevalent.
1438. This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published about two weeks after Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's surrender to the Japanese over the radio. Despite hopes that this declaration would lead to the official end of World War II, security remained tight at Oak Ridge and concerns about espionage increased. This official publication expresses positive opinions and patriotic attitudes toward the use of the atomic bomb.
1439. Issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin, a restricted, interoffice newsletter of the Tennessee Eastman Corporation during its wartime operation as part of the Manhattan Project. Of special note is the article titled "Groves Lauds Teamwork of TEC Workers To Make A-Bomb Success: Gave Japanese 'Face Saving Chance' " that describes director of the Manhattan Project Major General Leslie Groves's speech to Y-12 employees. During the speech, he claimed the Japanese government's statement about the high number of atomic bomb casualties was propaganda.
1440. This issue of the T.E.C. Bulletin was published about a month after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the day after Japan formally signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, which officially ended World War II. After the war, the United States had to transition back into peacetime operations. Homefront practices such as rationing and buying war bonds came to a close. Negative attitudes toward the Axis powers, however, remained strong after the war's end.
1441. Issue of the Commercial Appeal, a newspaper based in Memphis, Tennessee. This issue was published the day after the United States dropped the first nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Of special note are the editorial cartoon "No Japan" and the editorial article "Tremendous Power Unleashed," which presents arguments in favor of the United State's use of the atomic bomb for strategic and moral reasons.
1442. The American public and most of the industrial workers on the Manhattan Project were surprised by the news of the development and use of the atomic bomb when it was announced on August 6, 1945. In addition to releasing information on the attack, the federal government also prepared press releases on atomic energy and the sites of the Manhattan Project. For many Tennesseans, especially those in the Middle and Western divisions, these reports were the first time that they had ever heard of Clinton Engineer Works and the "secret city" of Oak Ridge, which they were also surprised to learn was the fifth largest city in their state.
1443. Issue of the Knoxville News-Sentinel, a newspaper based in Knoxville, Tennessee. This issue was published on the day that the United States dropped the first nuclear bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Of special note is the headline article, "Atomic Super-Bomb, Made at Oak Ridge, Strikes Japan," which describes the detonation of the "Little Boy" atomic bomb in Hiroshima and the development of the nuclear weapon by the Manhattan Project and Clinton Engineer Works.
1444. The American public and most of the industrial workers on the Manhattan Project were surprised by the news of the development and use of the atomic bomb when it was announced. In addition to releasing information on the attack, the federal government also prepared press releases on atomic energy and the sites of the Manhattan Project. While many in East Tennessee had heard of the mysterious Oak Ridge, even those employed by the Clinton Engineer Works knew only what their positions required them to know.
1445. Created by Henrietta Hickman, this scrapbook documents the years of her life between 1939-1947. She includes invitations and photographs documenting her social life, newspaper clippings regarding the Tennessee homefront and her local service with the American Red Cross Motor Corps, and clippings and other memorabilia documenting her service with the WAVES. The scrapbook closes with programs and additional memorabilia related to the many memorial services related to her death in 1945.
1446. Henrietta Hickman Morgan was born in 1917 in Gallatin, Tennessee. The daughter of Davidson County Judge Litton Hickman, she attended Ward-Belmont Preparatory School and Vanderbilt University. At Vanderbilt she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and Phi Beta Kappa honorary scholastic fraternity, and she was one of the first women to be editor of The Masquerader, the university�s humor magazine. Morgan was also a member of the Junior League, the Girls Cotillion Club, the Nashville Query Club, and the Nashville Red Cross Motor Corps, of which she was captain. She graduated from Vanderbilt in 1938. In September 1942 Morgan volunteered for service with the WAVES and received her naval training at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Appointed a midshipman in November 1942, she was commissioned an ensign the following month. She was among 50 students selected from a class of 900 for early graduation. Upon reporting for duty in Washington the day after receiving her commission, she became an aide to the director of convoy and routing. She was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, in February 1944. Lieutenant Morgan was hospitalized at Bethesda Naval Hospital on July 20, 1944, with an undisclosed illness. She died April 27, 1945, shortly before the end of the war.
1447. This article gives a brief history of school integration and how it came to be enforced in Anderson County, Tennessee. This article also answers "questions most frequently asked us," regarding integration specific to Clinton. An example:"why does the Board of Education and Principal Brittain pay any attention to the court order?"
1448. Letter dated July 14, 1943 to Governor Prentice Cooper from Lieutenant Colonel Thomas T. Crenshaw, Corps of Engineers, Clinton Engineer Works, Manhattan District. This correspondence demonstrates tensions between states and the federal government during World War II. In this letter, Crenshaw references an incident in which Governor Cooper is reported to have angrily torn up President Roosevelt's Public Proclamation No. 2 that designated Clinton Engineer Works as total exclusion area no longer under state control.
1449. Prior to the construction of Oak Ridge, the federal government issued notices to occupants of the Black Oak Ridge area of Anderson and Roane Counties that required them to evacuate their property. Governor Cooper had not been consulted before these notices were issued and had received reports from local citizens that the government was evicting them from their homes and undercompensating them for their property. Cooper had also heard that the federal government had not compensated the counties for the cost of building the roads and bridges for Oak Ridge. All of these factors created tension between the state and federal governments.
1450. This document is an example of the one of the extant county records for the State of Franklin.  One reason that the expression "The Lost State of Franklin" seems so fitting is the scarcity of surviving documentaion.  Official documents from the State itself prove the most elusive, and the only printed document is said to be the rejected Houston Constitution from the Greeneville Convention. The survival of county records proved quite uneven.  Some counties, such as Washington and Greene Counties, seem to have quite a bit of documentation to offer.  The parallel operation of North Carolina and State of Franklin courts proved detrimental to the records, for rival county courts clashed, resorted to violence upon occasion, and conducted actual raids to secure court records; all this led to the destruction of records.  The legality of Franklin Acts, marriages,court documents, and Supreme Court decisions was challenged in Tennessee and North Carolina courts over the years and largely recognized and upheld.
1451. This two-sided handwritten document contained on a small slip of paper represents the deposition given before a judge by William Terrel[l] of Washington County concerning a land entry belonging to Jesse Walton in Bumpers Cove.
1452. One-page handwritten proclamation issued by John Sevier as Governor of the State of Franklin requiring all citizens to ignore a manifesto currently circulating in the state that incites insurrection.
1453. The manifesto referenced was issued by the Governor of North Carolina, Alexander Martin, on April 25, 1785, reacting to Franklin's proclaiming its independence as a separate state. Governor Martin threatened the Franklin citizenry if they did not abandon this path and accused Sevier of being a traitor. Sevier countered with this proclamation that encouraged the Franklinites to obey their new laws and chastised North Carolina for providing the reasons for separation. Notably, Sevier evoked the Revolutionary War, dated the proclamation with the reference "in first year of our Independence" and ended with "God Save the State." North Carolina never recognized the independence of the State of Franklin, and it ceased to exist in 1788.
1454. One-page handwritten letter, folded to be addressed on the back side, represents the inquiry made by historian and collector Lyman C. Draper of Matthew Rhea of Fayette County, Tennessee regarding Draper's quest for State of Franklin records.  Draper details his project, some of his Franklin research coups, and the lead that brought him to Rhea.
1455. This inquiry from historian and collector Lyman C. Draper illustrates the mystery that has always surrounded the fate of the State of Franklin records. Here, Draper, the great document hunter, is pursuing them as early as the 1840s. The official state documents have proven largely elusive, though some county records have survived.  Repositories in Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia have holdings, but some appear to remain in private hands. Though a sizeable cache in the custody of Dr. J.G.M. Ramsey and the East Tennessee Historical and Antiquarian Society was lost during the Civil War, Ramsey confided to Draper, his long-time friend, that the Reverend Samuel Houston was said to have a multitude of Franklin records in his possession.
1456. Negative photostat (possibly from the Virginia state papers) of a two-page handwritten letter John Sevier wrote to the governor of Virginia, Patrick Henry, announcing the formation of the State of Franklin and Sevier's appointment as governor.
1457. This notification followed the first official meeting of the Franklin Assembly in March of 1785 and the subsequent election of John Sevier by delegates as governor of the State of Franklin. The letter represents Sevier filling his role as head of this newly formed state, communicating with another state leader, and informing Henry of trade negotiations with the Chickasaw undertaken by the State of Franklin. At the same time, Sevier, recognizing the volatile climate in the area, reassured Governor Henry that Franklin intended to incite no unrest in Virginia, nor encourage encroachment on Native American lands. Notably, Sevier mentions that he expects no official correspondence with Governor Henry until the State of Franklin is recognized by Congress, an acknowledgement that never materialized.
1458. Photostat of a two-page handwritten letter interpreted and written for the Overhill Cherokee chief Old Tassel to his "Elder Brother" (the Governors of Virginia and North Carolina) detailing the injustices heaped upon his Native American tribe by the infringement and encroachment of white settlers.  In this case, Old Tassel is specifically referring to the offenses of "a new people," residents of the newly formed State of Franklin.
1459. This letter from Overhill Cherokee chief Old Tassel to the white powers that be illustrates the angst suffered by the Native Americans in the vicinity of the State of Franklin by, not only white encroachment, but also the conflicting treaties that had arisen in the area. The confusion that the chief describes with treaty negotiations refers to the differing interpretations by participants in the June 1785 Treaty of Dumplin Creek. A token delegation of Cherokee attending John Sevier's negotiations on behalf of the State of Franklin contended they only agreed to allow white settlers present south of the French Broad River to remain. The Franklinites interpreted the treaty as opening the entire area between the French Broad and the Little Tennessee for settlement.  The negotiations Old Tassel referenced being held "by orders of the great men of the thirteen States" took place in November of 1785, and resulted in the Treaty of Hopewell with the United States government that ignored Franklin's Treaty of Dumplin Creek.  Continued encroachment of white settlers into Native American lands and these conflicting treaties turned sporadic clashes into warfare and sparked atrocities from both sides--one of them being the killing of Old Tassel in 1788.
1460. Feeling cut-off from a distant, uncomprehending, and unresponsive seat of government in North Carolina, western residents of the Holston-Watauga region felt compelled to seize the opportunity and establish the order, justice, and security they craved and felt was their inalienable right. Thus, they established the independent State of Franklin in 1784.  The Native Americans inhabiting the area proved the chief threat to that security in both the settlements of Franklin and the Cumberland, as this entreating letter from James Robertson to Franklin governor John Sevier attests.  Robertson, seeking aid for the embattled Cumberland settlers in 1787, clearly expected Governor Sevier to relate to their plight.  In the case of the State of Franklin, continued encroachment of white settlers on Native American territories and conflicting treaties sparked atrocities from both sides and turned sporadic clashes into warfare.  Lack of recognition from the United States, continued conciliatory offers from North Carolina, confusion in government operation springing from dual elections and courts, factionalism, and Native American conflicts undermined support for the fledgling State of Franklin and led to its undoing in 1788.
1461. Five-page privately printed and numbered (Number 21 of 100) portfolio containing an August 1, 1787 letter penned by James Robertson to John Sevier. Writing from Nashville, Robertson recounts Native American atrocities in the region and informs the governor of Franklin of the anticipated danger posed to the Cumberland settlements by the uniting of the Chickasaws, Creeks, and Cherokees to cut off the area in the upcoming fall. Robertson is hoping for the construction of a military station near the mouth of the Elk River or military intervention, and he asks the Governor to use his influence.
1462. The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1865 by veterans of the Confederate Army. At its inception, the Klan was initially a social club for young men seeking amusement and entertainment in the aftermath of the American Civil War. The Klan resisted the process of Reconstruction by intimidating "carpetbaggers", "scalawags", and freedmen. The Klan quickly adopted violent methods and the increase in murders finally resulted in a backlash among Southern elites who viewed the Klan's excesses as an excuse for federal troops to continue occupation. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870.
1463. This article from Brownlow's Knoxville Whig argues that the Ku Klux Klan does exist in Tennessee, despite attempts by others to "ridicule and denounce" the idea. It goes on to discuss the group beginning to organize in East Tennessee, the types of people who make up the organization, and their objectives.
1464. Caption reads: Who are YOU workin' for, Mister? This colored illustration features a man working in a garden surrounded by insects. At the bottom of the poster is a statement that reads "Insect Pests will invade Your Victory Garden." Be prepared to find and conquer them. The reverse of this image provides information on various pests including cutworms, white grubs, wireworms, aphids, beetles, caterpillars, and maggots and provides advice for how to avoid these.
1465. Home canning already had a long history in Tennessee. During the World War II period it received new attention. Through the use of posters, the United States government encouraged Americans to start "victory gardens" and can produce at home. Victory gardens would reduce reliance on limited food rations and help families put aside for winter. Convincing citizens to can at home also relieved pressure on the canning industry, allowing them to focus on producing food for soldiers and reducing the amount of tin used. Like all other war efforts, home canning and victory gardens brought US citizens together in support of the war effort.
1466. Information Bulletin Number 4 is a four page document that was issued to all county rationing boards in Tennessee. It provides instructions on restricting the use of tires, casings, and tubes that would use up the rubber supply. It is signed by Lytle Brown, State Rationing Administrator, Tennessee State Defense Council.
1467. Letter to Eliza Caroline White from William White regarding the sale of slaves. He details traveling from Nashville to Natchez, Miss. with a group of slaves in order to sell them and mentions that he will travel on to Woodville and St. Francisville.
1468. William White, 1818-1925, was the first husband of Eliza Caroline Wharton. He was an attorney in Gallatin who also served as adjutant general under General Andrew Jackson. They lived in Nashville.
1469. Letter to Eliza White from William White regarding the sale of slaves. He discusses the sale of Bill, Isham, and Maria for $1325 in United State Bank paper. He goes on to report the sale of Sam and Franky for $1300 and that he also expects to sell Lavinia bringing the total of his sale of slaves to $3425. He writes that "The sum I suppose may without much difficulty be converted into near $4000 which is a better disposition of the negroes than I could have made in Tennessee." He concludes by commenting on local culture stating that he doesn't like the manners or morals of the people in Louisiana.
1470. William White, 1818-1925 was the first husband of Eliza Caroline Wharton.
1471. Anderson Childress is writing to his sister Sarah Childress Polk about a run away slave. He writes that "Mariah had not returned to mother agreeable to your orders but started immediately after you, to Maury County,, the negroes here say that she threatened some time ago to follow you wherever you should go." He suggests that she get Major Polk to make some arrangement to have Mariah taken and concludes with a report of their mother falling ill.
1472. Sarah Childress Polk is the wife of President James Knox Polk.
1473. Sarah Childress Polk is the wife of President James K. Polk.
1474. This letter from John W. Childress to his sister Sarah Childress Polk reports on the status of runaway slave Mariah. He states that she always intended to return to Columbia because she desired to attend Matilda's Christmas frollick.
1475. Benjamin F. Allen married William Trousdale's daughter, Maria Louisa. Between 1853 and 1857, William Trousdale served as the United States ambassador to Brazil. Benjamin F. Allen managed William Trousdale's finances while he was in Brazil.
1476. In this letter to his father-in law, Benjamin F. Allen writes about the successes and membership of the Know-Nothing party. He says "The Know-Nothings wage war against foreigners and Roman Catholics, and have for their motto 'Americans must rule America.' They advocate principles in direct conflict with the free institutions of our country, and they must fall (as I think) as rapidly as they have risen." He goes on to talk about his own efforts to run for political office and offers details on his wife Louisa's illness.
1477. On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN congregated and marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company's stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates. When Governor John P. Buchanan called a special session of the Tennessee State Legislature in August to consider the issue of convict leasing, the legislature resolved to abolish convict leasing once the current contract expired. The miners felt like more could be done. Rebellion continued until the 1893 Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to construct a new state penitentiary and abolish convict leasing in 1896.
1478. This proclamation, directed to the "Law Abiding People of Tennessee," addresses the rebellion and insurrection at Coal Creek. The governor states "Lawless persons in great numbers in East Tennessee, at Coal Creek and vicinity, are in open rebellion and insurrection against the laws and constituted authorities of the State." The proclamation goes on to detail the situation, discussing the civil and military forces participating, and issues a call that "every Sherriff in the State to summon such posses as can be well armed, and do urge all good citizens of the State promptly to respond to such summons, and repair at the earliest possible moment to the scene of conflict...". The document appears to be a draft that may have been used over the course of the lawsuit filed between the State of Tennessee and the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad.
1479. On July 14, 1891, three hundred miners who worked in the towns of Briceville and Coal Creek in Anderson County, TN congregated and marched to the Tennessee Coal Mining Company's stockade outside Briceville. The stockade housed 40 convicted criminals who had been leased to the company by the state to work as convict laborers. These convicts took jobs previously held by local miners. The miners took control of the convicts, marched them to Coal Creek and boarded them on a train bound for Knoxville. This incident began a year-long rebellion aimed at convincing the state to end the convict-lease program that began in 1866. Rife with abuse, the convict lease program held convicts that were primarily African American. Prison conditions were deplorable with bad food, poor sanitation, and brutal treatment of inmates. When Governor John P. Buchanan called a special session of the Tennessee State Legislature in August to consider the issue of convict leasing, the legislature resolved to abolish convict leasing once the current contract expired. The miners felt like more could be done. Rebellion continued until the 1893 Tennessee General Assembly passed legislation to construct a new state penitentiary and abolish convict leasing in 1896.
1480. This document was submitted as part of a larger brief detailing the issues in the case between the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company and the State of Tennessee. It identifies the issues as follows: "Arrearages on rental, expenses paid by State for apprehension and return of escaped convicts, and the military expenses incurred and paid by the state." In August 1892, the State of Tennessee sued the Tennessee Coal and Iron Railroad Company (TCIR) over issues related to the convict lease. John A. Pitts, of Pitts and Meeks, whose letterhead this document was printed on, was Solicitor General for Tennessee. He alleged that TCIR owed the state $147,000 for back rental, the arrest and return of the convicts released by the miners in the fall of 1892, and the expenses the state incurred in maintaining a military presence during the rebellion. Negotiations continued on for over a year before the State and TCIR agreed to a settlement.

He notes "She had black vomit 21st 4 p.m. which continued till death. She also had suppression of urine. Her condition was very favorable until the death of her brother, when her nervous system became so excited as to render her recovery hopeless." Arnold Rhodes fell ill on August 20th at 1 a.m.. Dr. Tyner records his temperature and pulse until his death 48 hours later, on August 21st. Arnold Rhodes experienced similar symptoms but the doctor notes that his temperature must have risen above 104 1/2 degrees for his death to have occurred so quickly. Dr. Tyner also notes that "These cases were more malignant than any I have seen in the city."

1497. This letter from Dr. G.B. Thornton to Dr. J.D. Plunket details the efforts of disinfecting and sanitary work underway in Memphis to defeat yellow fever. In closing, Thornton states "I do not propose to declare the disease epidemic until the deaths from Yellow Fever exceed those from all other good. There is no practical good to arrive for any official announcement of epidemic soon." This is in response to the 1879 epidemic which resulted in approximately 600 deaths from 2,000 cases. In 1878, more than 5,000 died from 17,000 cases of the disease.

In line with the belief that agriculture was the fundamental wheel of forward economic progress, the national organization s spokes extended to state and local levels. J.R. Miles was the first and only president of the Tennessee Wheel, presiding over some sixteen hundred local chapters.

1515. Pamphlet containing the printed constitution of the Colored Farmers National Alliance
1516. The Colored Farmers  National Alliance and Cooperative Union was the natural result of the Alliance s refusal to allow membership to black farmers, who faced the same rising prices and stagnant profits that plagued all agricultural pursuits. Formed in 1886, the organization absorbed colored wheels in numerous states, including Tennessee, and surged to a membership of 1.2 million by 1891. Although they shared the general aims and philosophy of the Farmers  Alliance, the two found themselves at odds over certain legislation; discontent was furthered by a proposed, and ultimately failed, strike of black cotton-pickers. Lacking significant political clout of their own, the Colored Alliancemen were courted by the People's Party in the early 1890s.
1517. By 1896 the People's Party was losing its momentum as an independent entity, and would soon be assimilated into the Democratic Party. The monetary and anti-monopoly policies it esposed remained key issues in national and state politics for years to come.

1533. By the height of Populist sentiment in the 1890s, the Weekly Toiler had emerged as the official organ of the Agricultural Wheel and Farmers' Alliance of Tennessee. Behind ambitious editor John H. McDowell, the paper pushed for agrarian reform and backed politicians friendly to the causes of the farmers' movement.
1534. Writing to the Weekly Toiler from Williamson County, T.B. Reese appeals to the religious sensibilities of those sympathetic to the farmers' movement. These "most noble callings of man" were a powerful tool in garnering support for populist-leaning politics. The writer closes with an account of one of the many social gatherings organized by local wheels.
1535. Clipping from the Nashville American concerning the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Co. The writer notes that effect of the ruling will "absolutely protect the class of capitalists most offensive to the populistic element."

An exemption on income from rent or interest on personal property did not completely overturn the law, but made it toothless from the standpoint of the Populists. Not until the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 would their vision of an effective income tax be realized.
1537. Governor of Tennessee, 1891-1893. The nomination and subsequent election of John Price Buchanan as Governor was the high-water mark for agrarian politics in Tennessee. Buchanan beat out Jere Baxter and Josiah Patterson for the Democratic nomination, then defeated Republican Lewis Baxter in the general election. Though unable to secure the nomination again in 1892, he stuck to his agrarian principles, running independently and earning the support of the Populists.

1540. Tennessee assemblyman and president of the Tennessee Farmers' Alliance, John Price Buchanan would harness agrarian sentiments to capture the Democratic nomination and the governorship of Tennessee in 1890. His administration was unable to pass significant legislation for the cause, and was ultimately derailed by coal miner insurrections over the convict leasing system; nonetheless, he remains the political face of Tennessee's agrarian movement, which would fracture the Democratic party and give way to the Populists.
1541. Clipping from the Daily American discussing the possibility of the U.S. Congress imposing a graduated income tax. The writer supports the measure as common sense, quoting the New York Tribune in refuting the labeling of the tax's supporters as "socialists and property haters."
1542. Populists were ardent supporters of a graduated income tax, including it in their platform of 1892. Until this point, federal taxation had been focused on imports, exports, and sales. To impose an income tax would help ensure the wealthier class shouldered a heftier portion of the tax burden.

1545. Clipping from the Farmers' Alliance, reprinted from the National Economist, highlighting the anti-banking views popular among Alliancemen. The author discusses disparities in business practices between other industries and the banking sector, which lords over goverment, railroads, and the people to "rule with despotic power every condition of life." Also included is a piece on the conflict with the jute-bagging trust, a primary foe of cotton farmers, who fought soaring packaging costs due to the trust's monopolistic practices.
1546. Populism may be best seen as a movement to support the economic interests of the common man, or the populace at large versus monopolies and moneyed interests. The explosion of investment banking that accompandied the rapid growth of the American economy was therefore ripe for criticism from the populist element. The Populists' insistence on cooperation in opposition to monopoly has in turn left them vulnerable to a pejorative association with socialism.
1547. Article from the Nashville American regarding the surging support for the free silver movement. Various prominent Democrats and "Populites" are quoted in regard to the financial question.
1548. The Populists strongly supported the free silver movement, calling loudly and often for the "free and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1," in reference to the proposed exchange rate between silver and gold. The arguments for and against free silver raged well past the turn of the century; Populists called for the inflationary policy in order to increase crop prices and help pull farmers out of the depression, while the moneyed interests favored the gold standard.
1549. "Many Saw Portents of Stax End, But Disagree on the Causes," The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, TN Second in a series of three articles. This second article focuses on Stax Records legal battle with their records distribution company, CBS, Inc., in the mid-1970s.

Fort Loudon was constructed by the English in 1756-57 on Cherokee land near modern-day Vonore, Tennessee, with the permission and encouragement of the Cherokee.  But relations between the English colonists and the Cherokee degenerated over the next three years.  In March 1760, the Cherokee laid seige to the fort, in large part due to the English detention and subsequent murder of twenty three members of a Cherokee peace party that had been promised safe passage.  Facing starvation, the English surrendered  the fort on August  8, 1760, in return for a promsie of safe passage back to the English settlements in the Carolinas.  The fort was evacuated on August 9.  On August 10 the retreatig English garrison was attacked by the Cherokee near Tellico Plains and twenty-nine members were killed, allegedly in retribution for the twenty-three Cherokee killed by the English.  Most other members of the garrison were imprisoned by the Cherokee and eventually ransomed by the English.
1671. A black-and-white photograph of a shell ornament.
1672. The subject of the photograph is a gorget (a small plate or ornament suspended from the neck and worn over the chest) crafted from shell.  The Tennessee Division of Archaeology has identified the shell as coming from a lightning whelk, a type of ocean shellfish found along the Gulf  and Florida Coasts.  The shell was most likely transported intact from that area to Middle Tennessee, where the outer whorl of the shell was fashioned into a "Cox style" ornament.   Archaeologists believe that Cox-style gorgets were produced during the Mississippian period,, and these artifacts are believed to have been created between A.D. 1250-1450.  The presence of marine shell in Tennessee is evidence of the wide extent of Native American trade networks operating during the Mississippian period.
1673. A black-and-white photograph of seven Native American spear points arranged on a dark surface.
1674. The spear points shown were made by PaleoIndians prior to about 8000 BCE.  While the note on the back of the photograph identifies these artifacts as belonging to the prehistoric Folsom culture, state prehistoric archaeologist Aaron Deter-Wolf asserts that they are actually from the earlier Clovis and Cumberland periods.  Numerous artifacts from these periods have been found in Tennessee, providing evidence that PaleoIndians were present in our area more than 10000 years ago.
1675. A black-and-white photograph showing several rectangular stone foundations composed of rough-cut white stone
1676. The photograph was taken by Hobart Cooper, who served as supervisor of the 1936-1937 excavations of the Fort Loudon site.  These foundations were the only structures that survived from the original British fortifications constructed in 1756-57.   It is uncertain whether the fort was actively destroyed by the Cherokee after the Bristish surrender in 1760, or simply allowed to fall into ruin by weathering and neglect.  The excavation of the stone foundations allowed archaeologists to locate a line of wooden barracks built to house the British garrison.  The stone foundations may still be seen in the reconstructed fort at the Fort Loudoun State Historic Area near Vonore, Tennessee.
1677. A black-and-white photographic plate that presents de Brahm's plan for the fort, along with a profile (the elevation or ground-level view) of the completed structure as he envisioned it.
1678. The plate on which the plan is represented appears to have been prepared for Samuel C. Williams's book, Early Travels in the Tennessee Country.  It was inserted as a figure at the beginning of a chapter titled "DeBrahm's Account" (p.186), which reprinted DeBrahm's own version of his work on Fort Loudon .  DeBrahm was a respected mapmaker and military engineer who was born in Holland and trained in the Bavarian army.  He came to Georgia with a group of German colonists in 1751.  DeBrahm arrived at the site of Fort Loudon with the Brisitsh colonial garrison in 1756 and designed his plan based on the geography of a site which the Cherokee had specified.  He quarrelled with both the Cherokee and the first commander of the British garrison, and secretly left the site on Christmas night, 1756, well before the fort was completed.  His plan suggests a far more impressive structure than Fort Loudon, with its log walls, would appear when it was completed.  But it was still too strong for the Cherokee to capture by a direct attack.  The fort, however, was separated from the European colonies by the Appalachian mountains and by four groups of Cherokee settlements lying between it and the nearest other colonial forces. Its isolated location left it vulnerable to the Cherokee siege, and the Cherokee turned back the advance of a large British and colonial force which attempted to relieve the garrison in the summer of 1761.  Faced with starvation, the second British commander, who was the brother of the commander with whom DeBrahm had quarreled, surrendered to the Cherokee on August 9,1761.
1679. Brown single-fold paper booklet with silver American eage on front cover. Eagle is surrounded by thirteen silver stars, each representing one of the original American colonies. Printed in blue in lower right quadrant is "RATION BOOK and TOKEN HOLDER." On inside left flap, slots hold eleven red tokens and two blue tokens. All dime-size disks stamped with "OPA 1 RED POINT" [or] "OPA 1 BLUE POINT." Each has a letter combination such as WW, HC, XH, etc. Empty right flap was designed to hold ration books.
1680. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a New Deal agency created in 1941 to: (1) stabilize prices and rents, (2) prevent profiteering and hoarding, (3) protect citizens with fixed incomes from lower living standards, and (4) to encourage production. The war in Europe and in the Pacific caused many shortages on the home front, and rationing was a way to fairly distribute commodities and products. During this time the government asked citizens to sacrifice certain luxuries and necessities, so the OPA established a system of rationing that affected things most Americans took for granted. That meant scarcities of tires, cars, bicycles, stoves, gasoline, sugar, dairy, coffee, meat, cooking fat, bobby pins, shoes, zippers, nylon stockings, tin foil, and many other items. Tokens were used as a form of currency. Unfortunately, the black market thrived on the illegal resale of ration and token books.
1681. Booklet of war ration stamps (No. 470250) issued to Margaret D. Avery, Hoods Hill Road, Nashville, Tenn., by the Office of Price Administration (OPA). It contains three pages of perforated stamps; several are detached. Those marked "SPARE" are blue and are numbered sequentially. The others are marked with various letter and number combinations.�The last page contains a rare sugar stamp. The back cover is printed with an important message about salvaging.
1682. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was a New Deal agency created in 1941 to: (1) stabilize prices and rents, (2) prevent profiteering and hoarding, (3) protect citizens with fixed incomes from lower living standards, and (4) encourage production. During the war, the government asked Americans to sacrifice certain luxuries and necessities, so the OPA established a system of rationing that included gasoline, tires, cars, bicycles, shoes, zippers, bobby pins, nylons, stoves, sugar, butter, coffee, meat, and cooking fat, and many other items for military use.  On the back cover of Mrs. Avery's Ration Book 4 is an important statement: "When you have used your ration, salvage the TIN CANS and WASTE FATS. They are needed to make munitions for our fighting men." On the home front people organized scrap metal, tire, tin foil, and shoe drives. Bacon fat, for instance, was used in making ammunition and explosives. Each ration booklet contained several pages of stamps, labelled variously for sugar, coffee, gasoline, etc.Sugar stamps were used quickly for baking. Others were printed with mysterious combinations of letters and numbers. The war in Europe and in the Pacific caused many shortages on the home front, and rationing was a way to fairly distribute items. Unfortunately, the black market thrived on the illegal resale of ration books.
1683. Booklet of ration stamps (No. 937535BW) issued to Roy C. Avery, Hoods Hill Road, Nashville 5, Tenn., by the Office of Price Administration (OPA). It contains four full pages of perforated blue war ration stamps and one partial page. The stamps are numbered sequentially, 1-48. Each is printed with an image of a cannon, a tank, an aircraft carrier, or a fighter plane. The back cover contains instructions for using them.

Each ration booklet contained several pages of coupons, labelled variously for sugar, coffee, gasoline, etc. Others were printed with mysterious combinations of letters and numbers.
1685. During the 1950s, the African American citizens of Fayette and Haywood Counties struggled for full voting rights. Although African Americans had the legal right to vote, white citizens of these counties imposed roadblocks to keep blacks from voting. In response to this, African American leaders formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League and the Haywood County Civic and Welfare League. In June and July of 1959, these leagues held voter registration drives for African Americans so they could vote in the August Democratic primary. However, African Americans were blocked by whites from voting in the primary. This prompted the Leagues to file a legal suit against the local Democratic Party under the Civil Rights Act of 1957. As a way to penalize African American voters, white citizens of these counties compiled a list of all the registered African American voters and circulated it amongst white merchants, doctors, and other white business people. In response, many African Americans were refused goods, services, and insurance, and some lost employment and credit. Also, in the winter of 1960, many African American tenant farmers were evicted from the land they were living on and forced to move elsewhere. In response to this, several African American property owners allowed ""Tent Cities"" to be erected on their land. ""Tent Cities"" were where several African Americans established tent homes. The residents were sent food and other supplies from supporters from across the country while facing opposition and violence from groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens Council. By 1962, the situation in Fayette and Haywood Counties had been brought to the attention of the United States Government, and the Justice Department ruled that interfering with voting rights, including land discrimination based on voting, was illegal.
1686. This political cartoon, drawn by prolific political cartoonist Jack Knox, is titled  At Last! . This cartoon shows a man wearing a shirt labeled  The American People  in the foreground looking down on the Capitol building in Washington D.C. that is surrounded by a mob with a banner overheard reading  Tent City Mop-Up . Jack Knox was a political cartoonist for the Memphis Commercial Appeal from 1934-1945 and the Nashville Banner from 1946-1975.
1687. This photo shows the exteriors of some of the tents in the Tent City in Fayette County. This photo shows the size and placement of the tents and includes some of the residents in the Tent City. This photo is one of the photos included with the field report filed by Alberta Boyd.
1688. This letter, from attorney A.H. Gray of Haywood County, expresses appreciation to Ellington for his work in the Federal Supreme Court case regarding voting rights in Fayette and Haywood Counties. In 1929 and 1949, Gray was a State Senator representing Haywood and Fayette counties. In this letter, Gray writes about the Federal Government s response to the voting crisis:  [i]t seemed that the Justice Department was determined to make us suffer as much as possible and the Final Judgement that was entered was in the form of a permanent Injunction against about fifty Haywood County landowners and businessmen.  However, Gray goes on to write, the Government went against its earlier promise, which, as he understood it,  was to the effect that those cases would be dismissed without any Injunction going down against us provided the County Court here would take over the issuance of free food during the emergency periods of the year.
1689. During the 1950s, the African American citizens of Fayette and Haywood Counties struggled for full voting rights. Although African Americans had the legal right to vote, white citizens of these counties imposed roadblocks to keep blacks from voting. In response to this, African America nleaders formed the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League and the Haywood County Civic and Welfare League. In June and July of 1959, these leagues held voter registration drives for African Americans so they could vote in the August Democratic primary. However, African Americans were blocked by whites from voting in the primary. This prompted the Leagues to file a legal suit against the local Democratic Party under the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

By 1962, the situation in Fayette and Haywood Counties had been brought to the attention of the United States Government, and the Justice Department ruled that interfering with voting rights, including land discrimination based on voting, was illegal.
1690. This article discusses the suit filed by the Justice Department barring any interference with black citizens voting in Fayette County. This article also looks at the events leading up to the suit, including the discrimination shown by the African Americans  landlords, employers, and other white people. This article gives details of the discrimination and how the discrimination affected the daily lives of African Americans who tried to vote, such as employees being fired, tenants being evicted, and GI loans being denied. This article also includes population statistics for Fayette County, which is notable because, although the majority of the county s population was African American, 8,990 people, only 58 African Americans were registered to vote.
1691. This telegram is from Robert R. Brunn, a correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, sent from Boston, Massachusetts. In this telegram, Brunn requests stories from Travis on  Fayette and Haywood Counties on Negro Situation.  Brunn needed  social and economic background to understand  and  appreciate[d] balanced approach.
1692. This letter, written by attorney L.Kirby Matherne, expresses appreciation to Ellington for his work in the Supreme Court case regarding voting rights in Haywood and Fayette Counties. In describing the Federal Government s involvement with Fayette and Haywood Counties, Matherne writes:  [a]pparently the Government did not want to dismiss the suit in exchange for the food program deal. They chose instead to accept a proposed compromise which the lawyers had worked out whereby the Government took an injunction against fifty of the defendants here in Haywood County and dismissed the suit against twenty-three defendants[ .]we realize that the people with whom you were dealing have a tendency to say one thing and do another.
1693. This article discusses whether the Tent City is what it claimed to be a home for displaced African Americans or a publicity stunt. This article includes opinions and interviews of people such as the mayor of Somerville, I.P. Yancey, white defendants in the Civil Rights voting trial, and James Forman, coordinator of a Chicago committee assisting the displaced African Americans of the Tent City. The role John McFerren plays in the Tent City as its spokesman is highlighted.
1694. This article looks at the facts of the voting situation and Tent City to sift through what is truth and what is fiction or exaggeration. This piece discusses John McFerren and James Forman s leadership of the City, including their control over media visits and interviews. This article also looks at the shooting of Early B. Williams, and how the local police worked with the FBI to solve the crime. Also, this article includes a wonderful photo of a mother and her five children sitting in a tent in Tent City.
1695. This field report, written by the Coordinator of Social Services for the State Office, discusses the conditions of Tent City and the African American families living there. Alberta Boyd, sent from the State Office to investigate the Tent City issue, describes some of the people who live in the City and the reactions of Fayette County to Tent City and its residents. Boyd also mentions photos and applications submitted by people seeking assistance to move out of Tent City.
1696. This document contains summaries of the applications of Rosie Lee Bell, Elmarie T. Jones, and Georgia M. Tunner. All three women applied for assistance to move out of Tent City. This document includes information such as family information, the reasons why each woman's family moved to Tent City, and information about the City. All three of these applications were denied.
1697. This five page piece written by Fred Travis, staff writer for the Chattanooga Times, is a draft of a newspaper article which describes the events surrounding the Tent City event in Fayette County, and the city itself. Travis discusses John McFerren, the whites' reaction to the tent cities, and the conditions in the Tent City, among other facets of the situation. This piece shows the racist mindset of the time period as seen in Travis' words concerning the African Americans displaced to the Tent City: "[m]ost of the Negroes being put off the farm are ignorant, unskilled and, in some respects, almost child-like."
1698. This article draft written by Fred Travis discusses the trial in the Federal District Court concerning African American voting rights. Travis includes arguments of both whites and blacks and their sides of the debate on voting rights' impact on land usage. Travis looks at the evidence presented in court on whether or not African Americans who had voted were evicted from their tenant land because of voting. Travis includes quotes from eviction notices and also includes a quote from a salesman who was told by the store owners "not to extend credit to names that appear on a list." This list contained names of people on the Haywood County Civic and Welfare League.
1699. This article draft gives a very personal look at the African Americans affected by the land evictions and living in the "Freedom Village." Travis begins this article by describing Mrs. Georgia May Turner, a 58-year-old woman living in the Tent City, who is described using a hoe to drain the water in front of her tent to the road. Travis describes the tent where she and three of her children live, complete with Turner's refrigerator and stove that are stored outside the tent due to lack of electricity. Travis conjures up a great mental picture of the tents in Tent City. Turner's interview, however, is perhaps more striking. Regarding her former home as a tenant farmer on a white woman's property, Turner says, "I been on that farm just about all my life... I always done what she said. I never disobeyed her, and I ain't holding nothin' agin' her now... However,[l]ast summer I went down an register to vote and she say she seen my pi'ture in the paper. Then she tell me las' fall I got get off her farm, that she don' want me there no mo'."
1700. Letter from James K. Polk to Hagan & Heiss printing company. This letter reprimands the newspapermen for not printing Polk's political opponent Martin Van Buren's name next to his in an article. This omission apparently caused some of Polk's opposition to use the article as proof of Polk's "prejudice" in the presidential election.
1701. The presidential election of 1844 had a surprise outcome. Dark horse nominee James K. Polk, the little known former governor of Tennessee, ran on the popular promise of territory expansion. He grouped a conflict with Great Britian over the Oregon Territory with the annexation of the Republic of Texas. By promising to incorrporate these territories into the United States, Polk transcended fractions within the Decomcratic Party and defeated the much better known Whig candidate Henry Clay, as well as former president Martin Van Buren.
1702. This photograph features a young man dozing while awaiting his turn at the cotton gin.
1703. This photograph features a man by the name of George Whiteside and his nephew posing with a steam tractor near Swan Creek in Hickman County.
1704. This photograph features a man with three children on a early version of a tractor. The man is sitting on the plow blades.
1705. Two women are posing with an adolescent boy and a young girl while washing clothes by a creek in Whitleyville, TN. The photo shows washboards and washtubs along with kettles. Whitleyville is located in Jackson County, Tennessee.
1706. Myrlte ane Elgiva Summers of Catoosa, TN are washing laundry using washtubs and washboards. Catoosa, TN is located in Morgan County.
1707. This is a folk song about the presidential election of 1844, in which the darkhorse Democratic candidate James K. Polk defeated more established Whig candidate Henry Clay. The song humorously speaks against Polk with lyrics like "Ha! Ha! Such a nominee as Jimmy Polk of Tennessee" and "They poked it to the cunning elf by poking Jimmy Polk himself." This song was likely propoganda written and circulated by Polk's political opponents in the election. These types of propoganda materials, like music sheets, were widely popular because they were so easy to spread to the public.
1708. During the 1930s, drought affected the entire Great Plains area of the United States. There were four major droughts which mostly affected agriculture. Crops were damaged by lack of rain and insect infestations and dust storms were a frequent problem during this period. Federal and state governments implemented drought relief programs under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program.
1709. This political cartoon features a farmer with two cows and a farm house in the background clearly suffering the effects of a drought. During the droughts of the 1930s on the Great Plains, farmers and migrant workers suffered significantly from the lack of rain and its impact on agriculture. Under Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, programs such as the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation, the Drought Relief Service, and the Civilian Conservation Corps helped to alleviate the problem.
1710. Located at No. 89 Adams Street, Memphis, Tennessee, the owners of this slave-dealing business included Nathan Bedford Forrest, later a famous Confederate general during the Civil War, and his brother William. The bottom of the business card reads, "They will Board and Sell on Commission, and keep constantly on hand, a good assortment of Virginia, Georgia, and Carolina Negroes for sale." On the reverse of the card is written in pencil, "Sold Madison to Forrest," possibly referring to an enslaved person sold to Forrest by the owner of Belle Meade plantation near Nashville. Four enslaved individuals were killed in this brick building on Jan. 13, 1860 when it collapsed following heavy rains; Forrest, one of Memphis' largest slave dealers and wealthiest men, closed the business soon afterwards.
1711. On January 14, 1860, Nathan Bedford Forrest placed an advertisement in the Memphis Appeal newspaper, (p. 3), that read: "500 NEGROES WANTED. I WILL PAY MORE THAN ANY OTHER PERSON, for No. 1 NEGROES, suited to the New Orleans market." Forrest's business consisted in buying slaves from owners around Tennessee and nearby states, then bringing them to Memphis to resell for profit to cotton planters from the Deep South.
1712. The Mexican- American War lasted for a year and a half, from spring of 1846 through the fall of 1847. Mexican military forces invaded southern Texas, which had recently been annexed into the United States, in the spring of 1846 in an attempt to reclaim some of their former territory. President Polk responded by asking Congress to declare war and appointed General Winfield Scott to command the U.S. troops. U.S. forces eventually defeated the Mexican troops and Mexico signed a treaty giving the California Territory to the United States.
1713. These militia muster rolls from the Mexican- American War list the names of Tennessee men who enlisted in the militia. When President Polk asked the state of Tennessee to muster 2,800 soldiers for the war, around 30,000 men volunteered to fight. The militia ultimately had to implement a lottery system for volunteering and raised five regiments. This overwhelming support for the war effort cemented Tennessee's nickname the 'Volunteer State'.
1714. James K. Polk was president of the United States from 1845- 1849. As promised in his presidential compaign, Polk only ran for one term in office. During his presidency, Polk focused heavily on westward territorial expansion. The United States annexed the Republic of Texas, fought the Mexican- American War, and gained the California Territory under his guidance. Polk died three months after his presidency ended.
1715. Letter from James K. Polk to his friend Dr. Isaac Thomas informing him that his son, James Addison Thomas, had not been appointed to go to West Point. James A. Thomas would later go on to and teach at West Point, become a lawyer, and be appointed Assistant Secretary of State in 1855 under Franklin Pierce.
1716. Invitation to a ball celebrating the inauguration of President James K. Polk.
1717. James K. Polk was president of the United States from 1845- 1849. As promised in his presidential compaign, Polk only ran for one term in office. During his presidency, Polk focused heavily on westward territorial expansion and the United States annexed the Republic of Texas, fought the Mexican- American War, and gained the California Territory under his guidance. Polk died three months after his presidency ended.
1718. Letter from William Polk to Gideon Pillow. William Polk, President James K. Polk's brother, writes from Mexico City during the height of the Mexican- American War to his friend, General Gideon Pillow. The letter is about a recent scandal between General Pillow and the Commander of Forces in Mexico, General Winfield Scott. Scott had Pillow court martialed for exaggerating his role in several battles. In this letter, Polk reassures Pillow that his friends in the military in Mexico are sure that his innocence will soon be proven.
1719. The conflict between an arrogant young General Gideon Pillow and famous War of 1812 veteran General Winfield Scott started when Pillow exaggerated his role in a battle in Mexico on one of his military reports. Scott asked him to change it, which Pillow did. However, Pillow also wrote to a New Orleans newspaper under the guise 'Leonidas' claiming that it was Pillow who won several battles in Mexico (which were actually won by Scott and several other generals). Scott court martialed Pillow over this letter and other infractions. Before the trial could happen, President James K. Polk (who was a friend of General Pillow's and politically opposed to General Scott) fired Scott as the Commander of the Army and reduced Pillow's court martialling to a simple investigation. The court found Pillow not guilty and he resumed his position in Mexico. After a few weeks, President Polk also reinstated Scott as the commander in Mexico.
1720. The bitter feud between John Sevier and Andrew Jackson grew out of a dispute over military appointments both men competed over a position as major general of the Tennessee militia. The relationship between Sevier and Jackson deteriorated after Jackson accused Sevier of land fraud, asserting that Sevier conspired to destroy original records of land ownership, replacing them with forged claims. On October 1, 1803, the two men met on the steps of the Old Knox County Courthouse and traded heated words. Sevier brandished his sword, dared Jackson to draw arms, then insulted Jackson s wife, Rachel, resulting in a physical confrontation. Jackson lunged at Sevier with his cane, then friends of both parties drew pistols, and shots rang out as a bullet grazed at least one bystander. After allies of both men separated the two, a war of words between the governor and the judge quickly escalated in an exchange of letters. In their correspondence, Jackson requested  an interview  with Sevier a commonly understood term for a duel. Dueling, however, was prohibited within the borders of Tennessee, so Sevier offered to meet Jackson  at any time and place not within the State of Tennessee.  Thereafter the two men argued over the timing and location to settle their dispute. Eventually, Jackson met Sevier near present-day Kingston, Tennessee, where a failed attempt at a duel took place. Loyalists to both men provided conflicting accounts and details surrounding the chaotic events of that day in sworn affidavits signed by witnesses, and in published newspaper accounts of the incident. Ultimately, tempers cooled, but the animosity between Sevier and Jackson remained until Sevier s death in 1815.
1721. This letter is a response from Andrew Jackson to Governor John Sevier challenging him to a duel. According to the letter, Sevier spoke poorly of Jackson's wife Rachel, who had accidentally married Jackson before she was legally divorced from her first husband. Jackson wrote, "... In the town of Knoxville did you take the name of a lady into your polluted lips... and how sir in the Neighborhood of Knoxville you shall atone for it or I will publish you as a coward and a poltroon." This letter is part of a larger exchange between Jackson and Sevier, who wrote his own duel challenge to Jackson and accused him of trying to run away.
1722. This naval portfolio of eight Sarony & Major color lithographs depict scenes of the landings at Vera Cruz and Tabasco, the U.S. Steam Frigate Mississippi, and a collectio of U.S. Steamers during the Mexican-American War.  The cover page indicates that this portfolio was presented by Mrs. James K. (Sarah Childress) Polk to the Tennessee Historical Society on March 25, 1857.
1723. In 1891, Tennessee established the Board of Pension Examiners to determine if Confederate veterans applying for pensions were eligible. Eligibility requirements included an inability to support oneself, honorable separation from the service, and residence in the state for one year prior to application. Confederate veterans applied to the pension board of the state in which they resided at the time of application, even if this was not the state from which they served. Pensions for widows were first issued in 1905. These applications show place of birth for widow and soldier and information about their children. Proof of marriage was required, so marriage licenses often appear in the supporting papers.
1724. Tennessee Confederate Widow's Pension Application for Jennie Mays Watkins, widow of Private Samuel Rush Watkins of Co. H, First Tennessee Inf., CSA. Samuel R. Watkins is one of the most well-known soldiers in Civil War history. A private in Company H, he gained notoriety after the publication of his 1882 memoir, Company Aytch. Watkins was born in Maury County and enlisted in the army when Tennessee left the union in 1861.His unit fought at every major battle of the Army of Tennessee including Shiloh, Perryville, Kentucky, Stones River, Chickamauga, Franklin and Nashville. Watkins died on July 20, 1901.
1725. Tennessee Confederate Widow's Pension Application for Margaret Ann Klinck, widow of Hayne Irby Klinck of the 15th Tennessee Infantry, CSA.
1726. Andrew Jackson and John Sevier were bitter enemies. In 1803, John Sevier writes this letter to Andrew Jackson in response to Jackson's challenge to a duel. Sever writes "I have heard after all your gasconading conduct that you are preparing to leave town within a day or two, you have not named a place out of the limits of this State when you and myself can have a personal interview." Dueling is illegal in Tennessee at the time so Sevier is suggesting a location outside the state.
1727. In 1880 the U. S. Senate appointed a committee to investigate the causes of black migration from the South. Benjamin Singleton was one of the persons called to testify before the committee, and presented his reasons for encouraging the migration.
1728. United States Congressional Serial Set, 46th Congress, 2d Session, Senate Report 693, Pp. 383 & 384, 24 cm.
1729. Born a slave in Davidson County, Tennessee Benjamin "Pap" Singleton (1809-1892?) was one of the foremost exponents of black migration to the northern states. During his years as a slave, Singleton was sold to the Gulf States several times, but always managed to escape. He eventually fled to Canada, then settled in Detroit, Michigan. In the years following the Civil War Singleton became dismayed at the conditions under which the former slaves lived, and became convinced that his people's best chance for success lay in establishing independent communities far away from the South. The Edgefield Real Estate Association, which Singleton helped organize, was created to help the former slaves locate affordable land that they could settle and farm. Singleton found Kansas attractive because it offered federal homestead land. He travelled back and forth between Tennessee and Kansas, taking parties of emigrants with him, and�founded the "Singleton Colony" in Cherokee County, Kansas. Many of the communities that were established in Kansas failed for a variety of reasons, their residents moving elsewhere. Singleton eventually abandoned the idea of Kansas as a suitable place for black settlement, but never lost his conviction that the best solution would be the creation of a separate black state within the United States or, failing that, relocation to Africa. For many years it was widely held that Benjamin Singleton died in Kansas in 1892 and was buried in an unmarked grave. The Kansas Historical Society recently discovered through digitized records that he actually died in Jackson County, Missouri on 17 February 1900 at the age of 91, and is buried in an unmarked grave in Union Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 1833, President Andrew Jackson ordered that federal deposits be removed from the Bank of the United States. This action was very controversial and it eventually led to the destruction of the Bank of the United States.
1806. During the presidency of Andrew Jackson, one of the issues he faced was the nullification crisis that occurred from 1832 to 1833.

Many South Carolinians believed that the tariffs implemented by the federal government were unconstitutional and that they had the right to deny or nullify any tariff. Through a series of negotiations and a compromise that lowered the tariff, the nullification crisis with South Carolina and the federal government was adverted.
1807. This newspaper article is a transcription of a letter written by Andrew Jackson to William B. Lewis on the topic of nullification. In the letter, Jackson responds to Lewis's concerns over the tariff issue threatening the unity of the republic.

1916. The State of Franklin movement was a short attempt at the creation of a new state in the trans-Appalachian settlement of present-day East Tennessee. After North Carolina passed an act to cede its western lands to Congress in 1784, leaders in the trans-Appalachian region held a convention in Jonesborough to vote on statehood and to draft a new constitution. John Sevier was elected governor in 1785. Sevier faced opposition from an anti-Franklin faction in the region, led by John Tipton. The opposition grew and the movement for statehood slowly dissipated. By 1789, the Franklin movement had ended and John Sevier was appointed brigadier general of militia for Washington County.
1917. In this letter, Indian agent Silas Dinsmore reported to governor John Sevier on the white settlers illegally living and settling on Indian land in Tennessee.Dinsmore provided a list of the names of the white settlers living on Indian land.
1918. Silas Dinsmore was an appointed Indian agent and tasked with keeping the peace between the Native Americans and the white settlers residing in present-day Tennessee. Despite several treaties, white settlers continued to move westward, encroaching upon Indian territory. The increasing encroachment led to further struggles and violent attacks between the settlers and the Indians.
1919. In the late 18th century, there was an increase in white settlers moving westward and settling on Indian territory in present-day Tennessee. The increase in white settlements on Indian territory intensified the already-hostile relations between the Indians and the settlers. Despite several treaties, white settlers continued to move westward, encroaching upon Indian territory. Poltical leaders from both the United States and the Indian tribes sought peace and compromise.
1920. In this letter to Creek chief Alexander McGillivray, James Robertson discusses the death of Anthony Bledsoe and asks for more information regarding the reports of war between the white settlers at Holston and the Cherokees. Robertson asks for McGillivray's help in keeping the peace between the two nations.
1921. Elizabethton was the site of a textile strike in 1929. The strike for higher pay started when young women, many not older than teenagers, led workers out of two German-owned rayon mills. Many citizens sided with the strikers. Governor Horton sent in the National Guard to protect strikebreakers and the rayon plants. The Guard set up defenses on the mills' rooftops, while women workers blocked the access roads to the plants, and men dynamited the houses of "scabs" and the Elizabethon water main. About 1,250 people were arrested for confrontations with the Guard. Eventually, the strikers lost and many were blacklisted. The Elizabethton strike demonstrated the militancy of supposedly docile workers and the independence of young rural women. The organizers of the strike considered Elizabethton a test case for textile organizing in the South. Though the result was negative, labor militancy lingered in Elizabethon.
1922. Shows employees, mostly women, in front of the Elizabethton Hosiery Mill
1923. Governor Benton McMillin signing a child labor bill on Wednesday April 10, 1901. In Tennessee, the child labor bill prohibited the employment of children up to 14 years of age. Also pictured are (from left) John P. Murphy and William Hall of Knoxville, Chas. P. Fahey of Nashville and W.B. Eldridge of Memphis.
1924. Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." In 1901, House Bill 545 raised the minimum age to fourteen. However, the field of agriculture, in which the vast majority of the state's working children were employed, was not covered by either law.
1925. Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor.
1926. Two African American male child laborers standing behind a wood chair, each resting one hand on the chair's back. Both boys wear high collars and suit jackets.
1927. An employee is shown with machinery at the Sparta Spoke Factory
1928. The Sparta Spoke Factory was established on the Calfkiller River in 1896. It became the world's largest producer of wooden spokes. As the need for wooden spokes decreased, focus shifted to making other hardwood components. The company is still in business today as Sparta WoodWorks, which manufactures custom furniture components and specialty products.
1929. This labor legislation expanded upon the earlier 1911 Public Act 57, which forbade the employment of children under fourteen years of age and allowed the employment of children ages 14 to 16 under certain conditions. Those conditions were modified and extended in the 1917 Act to reflect compulsory school attendance laws for children. In addition to requiring a county school superintendent to sign a work certificate, it also required employees to keep strict time sheets that were subject to inspection by officials. The combination of strict work hours and need for work certificates helped ebb the number of child workers and encouraged education.
1930. This letter discusses details about 1917 Public Act 77, particularly whether it is lawful that children be charged a fee to obtain their work certificates from the County Superintendent.
1931. Louis L. Allen explains to Mr. Wilhoit, a chairman at Bedford County High School, that 1917 Act does not provide for any extra payment for those Superintendents issuing work certificates to children. He also talks about school physicians having the ability to issue work certificates, and that the law empowers County Superintendent to appoint representatives who can help do their work.
1932. Political cartoon depicting a "Child Employer" pulling an infant from its crib while the "Textile Conference" looks in through the window at them. The "Child Employer" states, "You're old enough to be workin' sonny!" Caption: "A Textile Conference called by Gov. Pattersonn will spend the next 3 days looking into the Child Labor Problem of the South - News Item."
1933. The Textile Conference (Oct. 15-16, 1907) called by Governor Patterson resulted in several resolutions. The employment of any child under 14 years of age in any manufactory or mercantile establishment was prohibited. They adopted a 60-hour per week schedule of all women and children under 18 years of age, with a provision that as soon as possible a 58-hour schedule would be adopted. It was established that a child under 16 years of age in any manufacturing establishment between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am was prohibited. A compulsory education law for all children between the ages of 7 and 15 years was adopted. The conference attendees also demanded punishment under the vagrancy laws of any able-bodied men who live in idleness upon the wages or earnings of their mother, wife or minor children.
1934. Men are shown with tools and machinery in the finishing department at the Sparta Spoke Factory
1935. Letters to the governor such as this one are indicative of the need for children to work to help support their family, despite the legal age minimum. In the response, the governor refers to 1911 Public Act 57, which prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14.
1936. Louis L. Allen, Chief of the Labor Department of State and an Inspector of Workshops and Factories, tells Mrs. Freeman that her son Walter, though only a few months shy of 14 years old, cannot yet legally work despite her request for a permit. This is just one of several examples of letters written to the governor about obtaining work permits for underage children.
1937. A strike is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work, usually in response to employee grievances. Strikes are sometimes used to pressure governments to change policies.
1938. Cashcroft, Mayor of Memphis, writes the governor, informing him that W.L. Mitchell, office of Factory Inspector, was in Memphis in the interest of a local strike that was causing trouble to Cashcroft. Cashcroft stated, "I desire to suggest that it would be well if the Factory Inspector were kept in Nashville, where he could attend to his duties and not be allowed to stir up trouble here."
1939. This article from the Birmingham Ledger, reprinted in the Nashville American, is an example of larger involvement and interest in the child labor movement. Citizens of the state of Alabama called for Tennessee's Governor Patterson to support child labor legislation in a conference called by him. The pressure exerted by forces inside and outside of Tennessee on Governor Patterson to approve legislation on child labor is indicative of the national political climate, as other states' and the federal government were pressed to pass similar laws.
1940. This is an article from the Birmingham Ledger, printed in the Nashville American charging Tennessee Governor Patterson with the protection of children with regard to labor issues. This article comes after Patterson called a congress of manufactuers and leaders of organized labor to meet to discuss child labor.
1941. The federal labor law made it illegal for goods made with child labor to cross state lines. In declaring it unconstitutional, the Supreme Court said that it was an overly broad use of the Commerce Clause, which is why it didn't have any effect on state child labor laws.
1942. This article states that though the federal child labor law was deemed unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court, the Tennessee child labor law will still be enforced.
1943. Employee versus employer court cases over labor violations became more frequent as the labor movement progressed. With labor legislation in place, workers finally had the backing they needed to defend themselves against workplace injustices.
1944. W.L. Mitchell, Chief of Department of Workshop and Factory Inspection, tells the governor about two separate court cases in Hamilton County that show violations of women and child labor laws.
1945. Governor's proclamation of Labor Day, Monday, September 2, 1901 in which he recognizes the dignity of labor, and realizes that upon it rests the prosperity of the state and well-being of the people.
1946. Labor Day became an offical federal holiday in 1894, just days after President Cleveland ended the Pullman Strike with army troops. In the late 19th century, as trade union and labor movements grew, unionists proposed that a day be set adside to celebrate labor. Labor Day honors the American labor movement and the contributions that workers have made to the country's strength and prosperity.
1947. Anne Porterfield Rankin wrote a manuscript in which she analyzes the problem of child labor and its causes.
1948. In her manuscript on the problem of child labor, Rankin explores the root of the problem, in which she identifies not only employers but also the parents of working children. She explores the religious and moral backlash of needlessly putting helpless children to work. She also talks about education and economic status. In the addition to the topic of child labor, the manuscript acts as an example of the racist, sexist, and classist ideas prevalent in the early twentieth century. Anne Porterfield Rankin (1869-1942) was a journalist and writer. In 1899 she became the literary editor of the newspaper the Nashville American. In 1908 she became editor of the Sourthern Woman's Magazine. In 1927 she became editorial writer for the Knoxville Journal and began the "Rain Pool" column. She also reviewed books for several publications, and acted as a leader, teacher, and did community service work with the Red Cross. Critics in the South proclaimed her editorials and columns as outstanding.
1949. After the Civil War, industries in Tennessee began to build and expand. By analyzing the grand divisions of Tennessee individually, researchers can better understand how industrial expansion affected different Tennessee regions, including which businesses became prevelant in specific areas. The conditions report is a snapshot of Tennessee's economy thirty years after the Civil War. During Reconstruction, industrialization was key to the South's economic recovery and growth. More so, the large-scale industrialization is indicative of the New South, an ideal based on modernization of the South's society and attitudes in order to integrate more fully with the rest of the nation. In other words, the New South meant moving away from the economy and traditions of the Old South and slavery-based plantation system.
1950. In this report, the grand divisions of Tennessee are discussed individually regarding their industry strengths and weaknesses. From the Sixth Annual report of the Bureau of Labor, Statistics, and Mines to the State of Tennessee.
1951. The Bureau of Labor Statistics was created by Senate Bill 241, which became Public Chapter 157 of the 1891 Public Acts. The Bureau was also known as the Bureau of Labor, Statistics and Mines, and incorporated the Office of Inspector of Mines which had been created by Chapter 247 of the Public Acts of 1887.
1952. The primary responsibility of the Bureau was to inspect quarterly all mines, collieries, mills, and factories where human life may be endangered. In case of serious accident, the mine, colliery, or factory owner had to report the incident to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. The Commissioner was also responsible for collecting, arranging and presenting labor statistics to the Governor and General Assembly. The institution of of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is an example of how the state government was beginning to regulate industry in Tennessee.
1953. Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." Before this child labor bill, there was no age minimum for child workers. Children entered the workforce at very young ages, as soon as they were able to contribute to a family's income.
1954. This is the first child labor bill, setting the minimum age limit of child workers at 12.
1955. In an effort to further limit children in the workforce, this bill raised the minimum age limit of child workers from 12 to 14. Although not the first bill on age restriction, this bill is indicative of the continual and growing effort to limit child labor.
1956. This bill reset the minimum age limit of child workers at 14
1957. Tennessee, which in 1890 had nearly seventy thousand working children between the ages of 10-15, was one of the first states in the country to pass legislation putting restrictions on the use of child labor. In 1893, Governor Peter Turney signed into law House Bill 6, which made it illegal to employ children under the age of twelve in "work-shops, mines, mills, or factories in this State." In 1901, House Bill 545 raised the minimum age to fourteen. During this time and into the early 1900s, an argument to counter child labor was education. Parties against child labor pushed for and attained compulsory education legislation. The education legislation affected the development of child labor laws. In 1911, a caveate was added to previous legislation that, in addition to a minimum age requirement of 14, children from the ages of 14 to 16 were permitted to work as long as they maintained obtained permission from their county school superintendent. This ensured that children at least through the age of 16 were being educated and kept the majority of child under that age out of the workforce. However, the field of agriculture, in which the vast majority of the state's working children were employed, was not covered by either law.
1958. This act forbids the employment of children under fourteen years of age, but permits the employment of children from fourteen to sixteen under certain conditions, which were modified and extended in 1917 House Bill 997, which became Public Act 77.
1959. This bill said that children between 14 and 16 years of age could be employed, during or after the school term, provided they secure from the County Superintendent of Schools, or his/her representative, a working certificate. It stipulated that such children could only be employed 8 hours in any one day, 6 days a week, and not before 6:00am or after 7:00pm of any day. Lastly, it mandated a time record be kept by the employer showing the hours that such children were actually employed, and the record had to be open to inspection by properly authorized officials at any time.
1960. Labor reform became a point of contestation in national politics. Later in Cleveland's seconrd term as U.S. President, he would send the army to break the Pullman Strike of 1894. The action was considered harsh and was protested against. In the wake of the strike, legislation was pushed through creating Labor Day. The leglislation, which Cleveland signed, arrived on his desk just six days after the Pullman strike broke.
1961. This is a political pamphlet discussing Grover Cleveland's opposition to labor reform, specifically during his time as Governor of New York and first term as president (1886 -1888). The pamphlet, most likely published just before the presidential election of 1888, is ultimately about the debate over convict labor, but it also talks about 10-15 other pieces of legislation, including child labor. It criminalizes Cleveland, the "Convict Labor Candidate," and ultimately presents Benjamin Harrison as the choice for the "honest workingmen." This is a good example of the federal climate with regard to labor reform.
1962. During Reconstruction, industrialization was key to the South's economic recovery and growth. More so, the large-scale industrialization is indicative of the New South, an ideal based on modernization of the South's society and attitudes in order to integrate more fully with the rest of the nation. In other words, the New South meant moving away from the economy and traditions of the Old South and slavery-based plantation system.
1963. This pamphlet presents "facts" about the South between 1865 and 1900, and concisely illustrates the South's economic growth during the Reconstruction due to industrialization. It comes from a larger booklet called "Manufacturers' Record's Baltimore-Southern Supplement."
1964. This pamphlet includes a description of "Industrial Conditions" gives an overview of labor conditions and wage in the early 1900s. Also included are sections on "Health" and "Monopoly of Natural Resources."
1965. This pamphlet provides general statistics about labor conditions and wage. Statictics such as these were key in determining issues in the broader workforce. The issues would be discussed and legislation would be proposed to set regulations for employers in order to protect the rights of laborers.
1966. Conferences allowed multiple governing bodies to exchange ideas on labor policies and ultimately determine courses of action that would benefit and protect workers and appease employers.
1967. In this three page report, the Child Labor Conference at New Orleans, held March 29-31, as suggested by Louisiana Governor J.Y. Sanders, two delegates from each participating Southern state were selected for a committee on resolutions. The Tennessee delegates were W.H. Johnson and Charles P. Fahey. The committee on resolutions made the 8 points in their report concerning child labor including age restrictions, definition of labor, eight-hour work day, and sanitary and safety regulations.
1968. This is a chart showing the beginning age of working women, categorized alphabetically by industry. Ages start at "Under 7" and 7, and proceed to 45 and "Over 45." There is a distinct concentration of numbers between ages 7 and 25.
1969. This table of women's ages at the beginning of work is an excellent example of the use of female and child labor. The concentration of starting ages between 7 and 25 shows how prolific the use of children for labor became in the late nineteenth century. Growing numbers and factory standards such as these, coupled with moral, religious, and political outrage led to the institution of child labor laws.
1970. Western Union telegram informing the governor that a state factory inspector named Mitchell is in Memphis "meddling in controversy between merchants and clerks union" and demanding that Mitchell be confined to his official duties.
1971. Copy of a resolution by the General Assembly of Ohio which states that it does not support the annexation of Texas to the Union.
1972. In 1845, the state of Texas was annexed to the United States by President James K. Polk. Prior to the annexation, many Americans opposed taking Texas into the Union because it was a slave holding state and it would contribute to the growing hostility between slave states and free states. Americans also feared that the annexation of Texas could lead to war with Mexico.
1973. Archibald Roane served as Attorney General of the Southwest Territory in the 1790s. He then served as the third governor of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.
1974. In this letter, Governor Archibald Roane writes to the citizens living in Indian territory explaining that the president intended to honor the land treaties made with the Indians. Roane tells the settlers that if they do not heed his warning and move off the land, they will be forcibly removed either by the courts or by federal troops. Roane says he has no power over this command and suggests that the settlers should follow his warning. He further tells the settlers not to contact him again if they choose not to leave the Indian territory.
1975. Archibald Roane served as Attorney General of the Southwest Territory in the 1790s. He then served as the third governor of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence. The Natchez Trace consisted of over 500 miles of Indian territories, including areas owned by the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations.Natchez was a well-known commercial road and essential in the development and settlement of present-day Tennessee.
1976. In this letter, Governor Archibald Roane alerts the Secretary of War of problems with bandits along the Natchez Trace. He expresses the urgent need to catch the perpetrators in order to protect the settlers traveling along the road. He says that it is unclear whether the bandits are primarily Indian or white. Roane worries that the bandits may put the treaties at risk if the settlers attack Indians out of fear, jeopardizing the treaties made between the United States and the various tribes.
1977. In 1803, the United States acquired approximately 827,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River for $15 million. This land deal with France, known as the Louisiana Purchase, was a major feature of Thomas Jefferson's presidency. The territory contained present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska and parts of present-day Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, New Mexico, Texas, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado, and Louisiana.
1978. In this letter, Roane alerts Tennessee Representative William Dickson that Congress will be meeting to discuss the Cession of Louisiana. In Roane's opinion, this matter is of great importance to the state of Tennessee and he recommends that Dickson go to the meeting.
1979. In the late 18th century, white plantation owners encouraged American Indians to participate in the practice of slavery. Out of the five major tribes, the Cherokee were the primary participants in the practice. The Cherokee slavery system resembled the white plantation system, including the sale and trade of enslaved African Americans.
1980. Letter addressed to Colonel J. Meigs from Governor John Sevier that describes the sale of a "negro lad named Andy" to Double Head, a Cherokee man.
1981. In this letter, John Sevier warns settlers living on Indian lands that if they do not leave on their own, they will be forcibly removed by the military. However, he also informs them that every effort is being made to extinguish Indian claims on lands. He says that friendly relations with the Indians must continue in order to obtain their trust and eventually settle on their land peacefully.
1982. John Sevier served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and led several Tennessee militias into battles against the Cherokee and Chickamagua. By 1798, he was governor of the newly-formed state of Tennessee. In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.
1983. Samuel Houston served as Tennessee's governor for less than two years before he resigned. After resigning, he chose to live among the Cherokee Nation, and then moved to Texas. He led the Texas Independence movement and served as Texas' president. Once Texas became a state, he served as state senator and later governor. He was eventually removed from his position as governor for refusing to join the Confederacy.
1984. This letter to Governor Samuel Houston from Sam Brown in Philadelphia regards a proposal by Brown's partner Letrell to establish a state library in Tennessee, and in every other state in the Union. Brown expresses his confidence that Houston will be in support of the library because of his liberal support of the Nashville University in the past.
1985. Letter from Winfield Scott to Governor Newton Cannon attached to a memoranda that is also written by Winfield Scott. The memorandam describes the duties, provisions, and wages of militiamen who will be working on the Cherokee Indian removal from Tennessee and Georgia to present-day Oklahoma. The attached letter informs Governor Cannon that the number of militiamen needed from Tennessee has been reduced.
1986. Winfield Scott was in charge of the Treaty of New Echota, a treaty that signed over the Cherokee lands in Tennessee and Georgia to the United States and forced the Cherokees to march to the "Indian Territory" in present-day Oklahoma. This treaty was not approved by the Cherokee Council, but signed by a member of the Treaty Party, a Cherokee minority political party. Under Scott, the project failed causing suffering for the Cherokees on their journey to Oklahoma. This journey was later referred to as the Trail of Tears.
1987. Series of resolutions adopted by the general assembly of Missouri. The preamble to the resolutions states that the southern and southwestern states will resist interference to their slave laws peacefully if they can and forcibly if they must.

Prior to that, he fought in the American Revolution, served on the Legislature of the Southwest Territory, and was the Speaker of the House for the United States Senate. After his time as governor, he became the United States' agent to the Cherokee Nation.In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to a hostile and often violent environment between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.

Sevier tells the Cherokees that the council in Knoxville is waiting for their opinion on the matter.
1999. Petition by the citizens of Dickson County expressing their distress in relation to the Embargo Act. The petition includes many citizen signatures.
2000. The Embargo Act of 1807 enacted by President Thomas Jefferson and made all exports from the United States illegal. The act was intended to punish Britian and France, but ulitmately harmed the United States economy. American merchants and farmers who shipped goods to Europe for profit were not in favor of the act.
2001. A petition written by the citizens of Williamson County to Governor William Carroll regarding the pardon of a slave named Harry who has been convicted of the attempted murder of his master. The citizens believe Harry should be pardoned because he was forced into the act by Sam, another slave. The citizens clarify that this petition is not the result of a master concerned about losing a valuable piece of property, but an attempt at justice.
2002. William Carroll served as the governor of Tennessee twice. In the 1820s, the American Abolitionist movement gained traction as more individuals, both black and white, sought the elimination of the system of slavery.
2003. Newton Cannon served as Governor of Tennessee from 1835-1839. In the 1820s, the American Abolitionist movement gained traction as more individuals, both black and white, sought the elimination of the system of slavery.
2004. This document composed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky contains an essay describing the wrongdoings of abolitionists and four resolutions explaining what is to be done regarding said abolitionists. The resolutions state that the Commonwealth disapproves of abolitionists and that if the national government attempts to interfere with slavery in their territory, war could occur.

He was also a signer of the United States Constitution and one of Tennessee's first state senators. He negotiated the Treaty of Holston and gained land west of the Appalachian Mountains from the Indians for the United States In the late 1700s, territorial clashes between white settlers and American Indians including the Cherokees and Chickasaws led to hostile and often violent environments between the two groups. Several series of treaties between the United States government and tribal governments were signed in an attempt to establish boundary lines and prevent further violence.
2009. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793. The machine easily separated cotton from its seeds, making it easier to produce. As a result, cotton production in the South increased. Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina all attempted to buy the patent from Whitney.
2010. In this contract, the Tennessee government pays Eli Whitney $10,000 for the rights to his cotton gin. The contract states that if another party proves to have a stronger right to the patent of the gin, the money will be refunded and the contract voided.

Other rules relate to strengthening the penitentiary's control over the prisoners.
2013. President Woodrow Wilson established the Committee on Public Information to create and disseminate information that would influence public opinion on the United States' participation in World War I. The committee, which operated from 1917-1919, was also known as the Creel Committee after its director George Creel. The Division of Pictorial Publicity created one of the most popular formats for these messages, the propaganda poster. Liberty loans, or liberty bonds, were war bonds created by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo. They were sold in the United States to boost patriotism and support the Allied powers during World War I. Bonds were sold to the public in different amounts as loans, which the U.S. government agreed to repay in full with interest in a specified number of years. There were four Liberty Loan Bond issues and one post-war Victory Bond issue. Altogether, these bonds raised about 21 billion dollars.

Woodward, Business Agent.
2026. Shortly after the United States entered World War I, Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917. This legislation made it a crime to spread information or misinformation with the intent to interfere with the United States military or to contribute to the success of the country's enemies. The law also punished those who directly or indirectly contributed to insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in the military. Tensions increased between American citizens, as naturalized and American-born citizens of German heritage came under suspicion concerning their loyalty to the United States.

2031. President Woodrow Wilson was intially hesitant for the United States to become directly involved in World War I, and America traded with both the Allied and Central Powers before entering the war in 1917. Two major events in 1917 that spurred the United States to intervene in the war were Germany's announcement that it would resume unrestricted submarine warfare and the discovery of the Zimmerman telegram, a message from Germany to Mexico that promised to help the country reclaim land lost to the United States in the 1840s. As a justification for entering the war, Wilson said "The world must be made safe for democracy," to a joint session of Congress.The Four Minute Men Association was developed during World War I to provide a means for dissemination of information on Liberty Bond drives. The organization was directed by the Committee of Public Information and acquired its name because speakers at meetings were urged to speak for only four minutes.
2032. Patriotic poem about rationing during World War I written by St. Louis poet Berton Bellis and sent to Governor Tom C. Rye. This work reflects the patriotic attitudes and spirit of self-sacrifice prevalent among Americans during World War I.
2033. At the Old Hickory Powder Plant, an entire city was established for the more than 30,000 people who lived in the worker's housing. About 1,400 of these residents were men, women, and children of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent who lived in a community known as the "Mexican Village." About 50 Native Americans from a reservation in Navajo, New Mexico also lived in this community. These workers were mainly employed by subcontractor, Mason & Hanger Company, who maintained the village. Between 1910 and 1920, there was an influx of Mexican immigrants to the United States due to the Mexican Revolution and provisions under the Immigration Act of 1917 that allowed Mexican immigrants to forego literacy tests. These immigrants filled manufacturing and agricultural jobs in the South left vacant by the military draft and the Great Migration of African Americans. The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operation and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.
2034. Photograph and article describing the community of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Native American workers at a Tennessee munitions plant printed in the Old Hickory News, a newsletter for the Old Hickory Powder Plant.
2035. After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Drafts and the need for war supplies led to labor shortages, which gave women the opportunity to apply for jobs in places they would have been denied employment before the war, such as munitions factories. More than 10,000 women worked at the Old Hickory Powder Plant, a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918 in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.
2036. Photograph of two women from the Old Hickory Powder Plant Box Factory dressed in their work uniforms, called "womanalls." One of the women is seated on a box, presumably made at the factory.

Miss Reba Wilson Gray is seated inside the booth, and Miss Annie Laurie Campbell is pinning a Red Cross button on a subscriber. The two women are dressed in Red Cross volunteer uniforms, including white veiled caps with the Red Cross insignia.  The booth's sign says: "10,000,000 Members By Christmas for the American Red Cross. $1.00" The poster behind the booth says: "Ten Million New Members by Christmas. Join the American Red Cross and on Christmas Eve a candle in every window, a service flag for every home."
2040. After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Shortage of male labor provided women with opportunities to enter the workforce or volunteer to participate in the war effort. American women volunteered on the homefront and overseas in organizations like the Red Cross in various roles. Some women assisted soldiers' families or produced garments and medical supplies for troops and victims of war through local chapters, while others took on various positions within the organization, such as nurses and drivers.
2041. Form speech written for use by the Four Minute Men Association. This speech attempts to refute arguments against the United States' involvement in World War I such as Germany's attitudes toward liberty, Great Britain's political motivations, the United States' economic motivations, and the interests of American soldiers. It urges speakers to reference specific events as justification for American involvement in the war such as the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, Belgian deportations, Dr. Dumba and Von Papen, the Zimmerman telegram, and "spurlos versenkt" messages against Argentina. It describes the Four Minute Men speaker's intended audience as American people who possessed "semi-understanding and lukewarm enthusiasm" for the war.
2042. After the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1917 were passed, there was a labor shortage caused by the draft that could not be filled by white women and immigrants alone. The increasing demand for materials during World War I provided southern African Americans the opportunity to transition from sharecropping to work in industries previously closed to them, such as manufacturing. Many southern African Americans moved to the North to pursue these opportunities in a movement known as the Great Migration, but some were able to find jobs in the South. The Old Hickory Powder Plant in Old Hickory, Tenn. near Nashville was a large smokeless powder plant opened by DuPont Engineering Company in 1918. The powder produced at the plant could be used for firearms and artillery. Though plant construction was not completed by the time the Armistice was signed, five of the six powder units were operational and produced 501,000 pounds of powder a day.

McKenzie also suggests organizing a network of African American schools in Tennessee to create programs for military training and volunteer service in organizations such as the Red Cross.
2047. The Selective Service Act of 1917 called for the compulsory registration and enlistment of American men regardless of race. While some African Americans were hesitant to support the United States' involvement in the war, many hoped that participation might lead to securing equal rights for the black population. Over 370,000 African American men were inducted into the army. The military remained segregated and most black soldiers were assigned to service units that performed manual labor, though the army did create two combat divisions for African American troops. Black college students were instrumental in getting an officer's training camp for black soldiers established in Des Moines, Iowa. Black women joined in the war effort as well by leading liberty loan drives, hosting rallies, and supporting black servicemen through clubs such as the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), Red Cross, and women's auxiliaries for black soldier unit
2048. Telegram dated April 3, 1917 to Governor Tom C. Rye from John E. McMillan, Mayor of Knoxville.

During World War I, she was on the verge of going to France to work for the YMCA as a canteen worker when the fighting ceased, thereby ending the need for canteen workers. Rankin also participated in Red Cross work, making bandages in the evenings, and served as a war worker in the powder plant in Old Hickory, Tennessee, during World War I. After the Selective Service Act of 1917 was passed, many American men were drafted into military service during World War I. Drafts and the need for war supplies led to labor shortages , which allowed women to apply for jobs in places they would have been denied employment before the war, such as munitions factories.

2055. This essay by Rutledge Smith, National Council of Defense Federal Field Secretary for Tennessee, advises Tennesseans on how to maintain sense of community and patriotism after World War I. He presents the United States as a global player whose citizens should concern themselves with providing aid to Europe. Smith also claims that Americans must combat social discontent at home by organizing as a communities through town hall meetings in every school district to discuss social and economic improvements and arrange charitable intiatives. The essay also touches on how to help veterans readjust to civilian life, the environmental impact of war, and the depletion of natural resources used for war work.
2056. Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of "justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.
2057. This segregation law, known as the first Jim Crow law, permitted discrimination in public places. This law covered all public places such as trains, hotels, and theaters.
2058. This publication is basically a travel guide for African Americans for train segregation laws in each of the Southern states.The introduction states that this little pocket-sized volume is 'to be a constant companion in the pocket or hand of every self-respecting, law-abiding Negro who is compelled to travel by rail in any of the fourteen states of the Union that have passed separate or "jim crow" car laws for the purpose of humiliating and degrading the Negro race." The Tennessee portion of this little book lists the portion of Tennessee Code and Acts that lay out specific laws regarding segregation on trains to maintain the "separate but equal" ideal.
2059. This photo depicts a man who was lynched and is still hanging from the tree on which he was lynched.
2060. This one page letter, from the ladies of the Davidson County branch of the Tennessee Woman's Christian Temperance Union, discusses the lynching of a black man that presumably occurred in Davidson County. While this letter does not give particular names, it states that the ladies were 'positively shocked at the double murder of two innocent men, and yet more so at the ghastly and horrible punishment meted out by white men to a negro brute' who was the alleged murderer. This letter shows the perspective of women involved in the Christian Temperance Union and their strong hatred of liquor which permeates this letter. Of the African American man who was the alleged murderer, the Union wrote that he was "probably crazed by bootlegger's liquor [and] knew not what he was doing when he committed the dastardly crime." The letter goes on to offer Governor Rye sympathy and prayers as he is faced with the hard problem of race relations and the lynching problem.
2061. This two page letter is from Reverend J.A. Jones, a former slave who was once owned by a prominent white Tennessee family. Jones, also an elder of a Nashville African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, discussed the lynching of a black man that occurred in Lexington, Tennessee. Not only did Jones reflect on this lynching, he also compared the lynching in Lexington to a lynching that occurred in Estill Springs, Tennessee. Jones particularly looked at the Estill Springs event and explained how a white posse, led by a former sheriff, turned the black man over to the "hands of an 'orderly,' infuriated crowd of respectable citizens, who proceeded to hang him." Written during World War I, Jones mentioned the African American soldiers fighting overseas and his desire to make the home front a safe place for them and a place that is worthy of them defending with their lives. At the end of his letter, Jones appealed to Governor Rye to bring those responsible for the lynching to justice.
2062. This two page letter is a plea from two members of the Shelby County Criminal Court staff. This letter concerns a man named Ell Parsons who was charged with raping and murdering a white girl. Puryear and Harsh explained how fear for Parsons' life and the risk of lynching in Shelby County caused him to be transferred to the Davidson County jail, although threats persisted against his life upon his return. Even the sheriff was threatened and the fear of his lynching was so great that he also fled Shelby County. This letter is an appeal to Governor Rye to send the Militia to Shelby County to protect against the lynching mobs.
2063. This short letter, postcard size with writing on both the front and back side, is from a former mob leader whose name is not given. While not including explicit racial words, the language of this note definitely shows the racism that was strong among mob members. The author of this letter is urging Governor Rye to "not interfere with the electrocution of the black animals for such crimes as they have been doing lately." The author tells Rye that if justice is given by the government to black criminals (aka execution), then mob violence will end. The back of this note states, "womanhood is our glory and what keeps us all from being barbarians so let us all protect it and give thanks that we have it in this world to protect." This statement demonstrates the myth that permeated the time period that lynching black men was a way to protect white females.
2064. This headline article actually makes up most of the entire front page of this newspaper issue, with a small portion of it continuing on the second page. This item discusses various aspects of a lynching event, including describing the lynch mob's acquisition of Ed Johnson, the involvement of the sheriff, and the lynching itself. This article explains lynching without using overly graphic language while still displaying lynching as a violent act.
2065. Jim Crow Laws were policies and regulations regarding segregation of African Americans in the United States from the Reconstruction Era through the 1960s. Jim Crow laws dictated segregation in all aspects of life, including transportation, housing, entertainment, and access to things such as water fountains and entryways to buildings. Jim Crow was mainly prevalent in the Southern states, but was also found in some Northern states. The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1892 resulted in the legal mandate of "separate but equal," a main tenant of Jim Crow. Although Jim Crow laws were very restrictive, African Americans were further persecuted by groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups. Often, African Americans were lynched as a form of 
"justice" for alleged crimes. Lynchings were violent occurrences that often became town spectacles that citizens would attend much like a performance.
2066. This one page letter, from a citizen of Spencer, Tennessee, begged Governor Peay for protection from lynching. D.L. Robinson stated that he has had "two crowds to come to my house at night in clansmen robes and threaten to burn my house and hang me" if he did not leave town by a certain date. Although this letter does not state why Robinson was being threatened, it gives a good example of the fear that the Ku Klux Kan often instilled in citizens.
2067. This two page letter, from Memphis resident Elizabeth L. Koen, condemns white people that took part in a lynching that included the burning a black man. The opening line of this letter is particularly eye catching: "If a white man should murder a negro woman, and a negro mob should throw the white man's charred head at us-what then!" Koen went on to condemn whites for their violence against blacks and stated that "more is to be expected of white people than black ones." Koen concluded her letter by stating "Any person who believes that all barbarians in this country are black, is color blind." Although this letter certainly has a racist overtone, it also shows the disgust and dismay of some whites at the behavior of lynch mobs.
2068. This four page pamphlet discusses why women formed the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching and why they stood against lynching, specifically the lynching of blacks by white men. From 1921-1930, 211 lynchings were conducted. After the Association was founded in 1930, 21 lynchings took place that year. This pamphlet also gives lynching statistics through 1938 which saw the lowest number of lynchings until that time. This work argues against the common myth that lynchings were conducted to protect white women. This work also gives examples of how real women were instrumental in preventing lynchings.The publication ends by describing how the Association was working with law enforcement to sign a pledge to educate against lynchings and prevent mob action.
2069. In this letter, Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn writes to Secretary of State Daniel Graham to assure him that he is doing all he can to encourage the Cherokee people to surrender their lands to the United States and remove west of the Mississippi River. He describes the previous day's speeches to the Cherokees and their reactions, and confesses he will be glad when his work is finished in that place so he can have a more relaxing life. He states that nothing in that place would be accomplished if he was not there. The letter is handwritten and has several stamped seals on the pages.
2070. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. Though this letter is dated before what is typically held as the Removal Period, it is a good example of how many years the United States had been pressuring the Native Americans to give up their ancestral lands.
2071. Adam Fergusson writes this 4-page letter to his wife, Hester Ann, to update her on the status of their farm. He begins by saying he arrived and everything is safe, but the harsh frost makes growing cotton difficult. He describes the local economy and growth. Of particular interest is a description of an encampment of Creek Indians from Alabama waiting to cross the river at Memphis, Tennessee, on their journey of removal to the Indian Territory.
2072. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the various tribes of Native Americans to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. In 1825, the United States Government signed the Treaty of Indian Springs with William McIntosh, ceding all Creek lands east of the Mississippi. After investigation, it was discovered that McIntosh did not have the authority of the Creek National Council and the treaty was nullified in 1826, making it the only treaty between the United States and an Indian tribe to be overturned. However, in 1836, conflict between the Creeks and white settlers resulted in a series of battles known as the Second Creek War. In response to this war, the United States forced all Creeks to remove to territory west of the Mississippi River.
2073. In this 2-page letter, Lewis Ross writes his brother, Cherokee Chief John Ross, about the options for the removal of the Cherokee Tribe. He states that given the circumstances, he fears there is nothing his brother will be able to do in Washington but to negotiate the terms of removal. He states that there are only two options presented to the people - either to stay and be forced off their lands under the terms of the false treaty or to negotiate their own terms that could be more satisfactory to the Nation. He suggests that they should negotiate for more time to remove, their own control of the money, and to be allowed to remove to where they choose. He goes on to say they will likely receive nothing more from the United States Government than more oppression as long as they are within the limits of the country and perhaps they could find a different country in which to settle. He knows the people place high expectations and pressure on his brother and they are all waiting in suspense for the news from him.
2074. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.
2075. This is a draft of the treaty the Cherokee Nation developed after the Treaty of New Echota was made. It is hand written by Chief John Ross and there are several places left blank for negotiations. This treaty was an effort to gain better terms for the removal west. It contains 11 articles (although Article 11 is mislabeled at Article 12) as follows: the Cherokees cede all their lands east of the Mississippi to the United States; the United States will pay a certain sum (left blank) for the land; another sum (left blank) for expenses of removal; a fee will be paid to the Cherokee for previously exchanged land; the improvements made by the Cherokees east of the Mississippi will be assessed by the U.S. Agents and Cherokee delegation and paid for by the Cherokees; the Cherokees will withdraw no later than 2 years from ratification; the U.S. will protect the Cherokee during removal; the Cherokees will vacate Georgia first with the understanding that the U.S. will pay an allowance for lost crops; and all Cherokees imprisoned will be released and allowed to remove with the rest of the nation under the same conditions.
2076. This 4-page letter was written by Lewis Ross to his brother, Cherokee Chief John Ross. In the letter, L. Ross describes a vote that was taken by the Cherokees about the payment of monies due the Tribe according to former treaties. He describes the location of the vote, to whom the payments would be made, how many voted, and who was appointed as judges of the vote. He goes on to describe how General Wool announced there had been a treaty made that would require the removal of the Cherokees within two years and if they did not comply, they would be forcibly removed by United States Troops, and there were various provisions being offered to them. Ross says that the people did not seem impressed by the speech, remarking that they had no desire for the items being offered. At the end of the election, General Wool invited several of the leading men to visit him, and they discussed the removal and he encouraged them to take some of the provisions. Ross immediately suggests his brother look into the amount of money that was reported as due to the Cherokees, thinking they were quoted the wrong amount. He also describes the arrests of several Cherokees on charges of opposing the Treaty and exciting the people against it. He conveys the anxiety of the people waiting to know what the results of the delegation in Washington will mean for their Nation.
2077. In this letter 4-page letter, Cherokee Chief John Ross writes to Martin Van Buren regarding confusion over a treaty made with the Cherokee Council's approval. He states that he and Edward Gunter were supposed to meet with John Mason, a representative of the American government, for an informal negotiation before the formal delegation was to meet in an effort to create a treaty. He explains that they were baffled to receive word that negotiations had been closed before they had even been opened, and a circular informing the Nation about a treaty made was sent to the Nation. He states that he presented a protest about this treaty to Congress but they told him to present it to the President. He closes his letter by saying that, since the proposal for a treaty in which the Cherokees would be able to keep their lands and become citizens of the United States was rejected by the U. S. Government, the Cherokee viewed it necessary to enter into a treaty of cession.
2078. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. At the end of this two-year period, in 1838, the U. S. Government began forcibly removing the Cherokee people to their new territory in the West.
2079. In this letter, Thomas Williams writes to General John Coffee to offer his suggestions about the land in Mississippi held by Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. He begins by acknowledging Coffee, as a Commissioner, is fully aware of the negotiations being held for the cession of Indian claims to land within the boundaries of the state of Mississippi. He continues to give his opinion on what stipulations and proposed borders should be offered to the Nations, and gives alternate suggestions should the Tribes refuse the first suggestions.
2080. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the various tribes of Native Americans to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River.
2081. After the signing of the fraudulent Treaty of New Echota in 1835 by a minority group of Cherokees, led by Major Ridge, conflict over the tribe's removal and the treaty resulted in a fraction of the tribe into two parties, one supporting removal led by Ridge and the other against removal led by Chief John Ross. In 1838, the United States began forcibly removing nearly 17,000 Cherokees to lands west of the Mississippi River. Their long journey, coupled with little food or protection from disease and extreme elements, led to the death of thousands of Cherokees and became known as the Trail of Tears. Upon reaching the new Indian Territory the two groups of Cherokees faced more conflict over which party should maintain control over the Tribe. However, because the Cherokee Nation Council had established a law ordering the execution of anyone who negotiated the cession of Cherokee lands, most of the leaders of the Ridge party were assassinated shortly after the Tribe arrived in Arkansas. Henry Benton Henegar served as wagonmaster and secretary to Chief John Ross.
2082. This letter, dictated by H. B. Henegar and transcribed by his wife, is a response to a request from Ed Porter Thompson for more information regarding the removal of the Cherokee Indians in 1838 and 1839. Henegar, who was employed by John Ross during the Removal period, starts his reply to Thompson by describing the place in Bradley County, Tennessee, where the Cherokees he accompanied were collected by the United States troops under the orders of General Winfield Scott. He explains the division of the Cherokee people into smaller groups, called detachments, and the process for each group's removal. According to his letter, Henegar states all the Cherokee detachments that were collected at this spot in Bradley County traveled the same route to the West through Tennessee and parts of Kentucky and Illinois before crossing the Mississippi River into Missouri. He describes his detachment getting stuck in the middle of the Mississippi River for three weeks when it froze. From there they traveled to the Indian Country in Arkansas where they dispersed and settled. He goes on to describe the events that happened after their relocation, including the creation of a new constitution and the conflict between the Ross and Ridge parties. He also gives an account of the assassinations of several Ridge party members who signed the Treaty of New Echota, though he believes Ross was not involved in organizing these attacks.
2083. This 3-page letter to Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn was written by Chief John Ross and the Cherokee Council for publication in the Raleigh Register. In the letter, the Council states they have reviewed with close attention the proposal for a total cession of their ancestral lands east of the Mississippi River to the United States. The letter goes on to list several provisions in the latest treaty for a census of Cherokee people to be taken. They question why the treaty was not closed on the date provided by the treaty and acknowledge their desire for the Cherokee people to be allowed the choice to remove or to stay on their ancestral lands. They reject any proposal for total cession and desire the last treaty be closed as agreed.
2084. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal.
2085. In this 6-page letter, Cherokee Chief John Ross acknowledges that the Cherokee Nation is aware of President Andrew Jackson's desire to remove the Indians to the west. Ross references a previous letter in which a meeting was requested with the Cherokees to discuss a treaty for removal. He plainly states that the Cherokee Nation is not interested in meeting for a discussion because they are convinced there is nothing the United States Government can offer that will change their disposition against removal from their ancestral lands. Ross says that the Executive Department of the Nation is always willing to receive official representatives from the President to discuss various topics. He relays concern about the States being granted jurisdiction over the portion of the Cherokee Nation with each State's territory and believes that whatever decision is made has the potential to benefit or doom the Nation. He ends the letter with the assurance that the Cherokees are the allies of and depend upon the United States, having fought wars with the U.S., and they desire peace with the American people.
2086. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal, though they were willing to maintain alliances with the United States.
2087. This 16-page letter written by U.S. Secretary of War John Eaton to the Cherokee delegation gives the view of President Andrew Jackson on the Cherokee Nation's concerns. He responds to their claims that Georgia is overreaching their authority with the statement that during the Revolutionary War, the Cherokees allied themselves with Great Britain. Eaton claims that when Great Britain was defeated, the individual states gained sovereignty over the lands controlled by Great Britain, which included Cherokee territory within the states' borders, and that the Cherokees were subject to the states' authority and have been permitted by those states to live on and use the land. He goes on to state that the oppression from Georgia is a result of the Cherokee people's attempt to establish themselves as an independent nation within the boundaries of Georgia. He claims Georgia is within its constitutional right as established by the treaty of 1783, ending the Revolutionary War, to exercise authority over all within the boundaries of the state, and the federal government cannot take that right away from the states. He suggests that the Cherokees' only option is to remove to the West because staying within the territory of a state will only continue the oppression. Eaton relates the feelings of President Jackson towards the Cherokee people saying it is the President's desire for the Cherokee people to relocate to a land where they can be free to maintain their traditions and society and the U. S. government can protect them from the encroachment of American citizens.
2088. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. President Andrew Jackson, often referring to himself as a father or brother to the Native Americans, believed the best hope for the survival of the Native American tribes was removal and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. Government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west.
2089. After President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Bill of 1830, the United States began negotiating the removal of all of the Native American tribes residing east of the Mississippi River to lands in the west. This publication is an attempt to better organize and document the removal of the tribes.
2090. This booklet was a publication printed by the United States War Department and outlines the regulations for conducting the business of removing the Indians from the Southeast to the territory west of the Mississippi River. It outlines the Directing Department, special agents, disbursements, transportation, supplies, provisions, appraisement and payment of property, miscellaneous and compensation relating to the removal. The opening paragraph states that the observations of the past year ""have led to the convictions, that a more systemic plan of operations is essential to the economy and to the satisfactory progress of these movements."" It states what the emigrants can and cannot carry with them, how much each person is to receive in rations, what items are to be provided to them, how much they will be paid for their property and compensation to those hired to help remove them. The forms at the back of the book are an example of how these things are to be recorded and submitted to the Office of Commisary General of Subsistence.
2091. H. B. Henegar was employed by Cherokee Chief John Ross as wagonmaster and secretary during the Indian Removal of 1838-1839. He traveled with a detachment of Cherokees to their new country in Arkansas, west of the Mississippi River.
2092. In this letter, Thompson writes to Henegar stating he had read an article that listed Henegar among the people who traveled west with the Indian tribes during Removal. Thompson requests details about the route they followed to the Indian Territory and the length of time it took to make the journey. He continues by saying the accepted historical accounts implied the tribes traveled due west through the lower Southern states of Alabama and Mississippi, but he had heard a recent account claiming the routes went through other Southern states and any information Henegar could provide would be helpful to his writings on the topic.
2093. George F. Mellen was a journalist for several notable publications, including the Knoxville Sentinel. He wrote about a variety of topics and time periods ranging from frontier history to state politics. He frequently wrote about the relations between the United States and the Cherokee Nation.
2094. This newspaper article was written by George Frederick Mellen, a journalist for the Knoxville Sentinel in the early 1900s. The article describes Mellen's visit to Col. Thomas Leroy Bates' home in Tasso in Bradley County, Tennessee. At the time the article was written in 1914, Bates was the last living person connected with the Cherokee Removal. Bates was nineteen years old at the time of the removal in 1838, and helped his father furnish two wagon teams for the Cherokees' journey. Though Bates did not travel the entire journey to the Indian Territory, he did travel the first day with them to help break the horses on an unexperienced team. The article continues by relaying Bates' knowledge of the Cherokee people and their lives before removal, describing the people, the festivities, and religion, as well as the camps in which the Cherokee people were gathered by General Scott's force before beginning their journey. The article ends with Mellen's description of their attempt to visit Rattlesnake Springs, one of the collection sites for the Cherokees. It also contains a small, black and white portrait of Mellen.
2095. John Ross was the first and only elected Cherokee chief. He served in this capacity from 1828 to 1866 and is most known for his opposition to the removal of the Native Americans to lands west of the Mississippi River. When the Cherokee tribe was forced to remove during 1838-1839, John Ross sold his property and traveled to Arkansas with his people and continued to serve as their chief in this new territory.

2099. This type-printed circular was written by General John E. Wool and states that it has been a year since he came to the Cherokee Nation with the announcement regarding the treaty for removal and expresses disappointment that the Nation did not listen to him. He reminds them that they have one more year before the time designated by the treaty for relocating before military force will be used to remove those who remain east of the Mississippi. He questions why they would wait or why they would desire to stay and live a life oppressed by the encroaching white men. He encourages them to settle their affairs and prepare to voluntarily remove before May 23rd, 1838, so they can take advantage of both the provisions and protection he is able to provide until the time of military enforced removal.
2100. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River. President Andrew Jackson, often referring to himself as a father or brother to the Native Americans, believed the best hope for the survival of the Native American tribes was removal and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which authorized the U. S. Government to negotiate with the Native American tribes treaties for the cession of lands and removal west. The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal.

This fradulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and alloted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.
2101. Robert Armstrong was a surveyor on the western frontier of the United States and often surveyed lands for the Cherokee Nation. It was provided for in treaties with U. S. that Cherokee chiefs were alloted a portion of land to develop as their private residence.
2102. This hand-drawn survey of land by Robert Armstrong was made for Lewis Ross, brother of the famous Cherokee Chief John Ross, in 1820. Armstrong includes a map of the property located on the Hiwassee River as well as a geographical description of the boundaries for the property.
2103. This type-printed order, written by General John E. Wool, states that the President of the United States is not willing to renegotiate the terms of the "late treaty" for Removal and any attempt to do so would be considered an act of hostility against the execution of the Treaty. The order threatens disciplinary action against both Native Americans and white citizens thought to be inciting opposition to the Treaty.
2104. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the American government continually pressed the Cherokee Nation to cede their ancestral lands and remove to lands west of the Mississippi River.

He explains that the United States Government has arranged for steam boats to transport them down the river or they can choose to take the longer route by foot.
2106. This is a 2-page letter written by Cherokee Chief John Ross and addressed to Majors Irwin and Barron. Ross states that the Cherokee Council does not approve of the "nefarious 'treaty' and declared it to be a fraud... and an act of oppression on the Cherokees." He goes on to say that the Cherokee Council is willing to meet with officers from the United States Government to create an approved treaty that will satisfy both the Cherokees and the United States. He goes on to say it is his goal to serve the wishes of the Cherokee people as a whole. Additionally, in a post script, Ross states that there are pending cases in court about illegal fees collected that have not been dealt with and expects the recipients will take care of them.
2107. This newspaper article announces a treaty was made between Indian Commissioner John F. Schermerhorn and a delegation from the Cherokee Tribe. Because of the length of the treaty, the publication could not print the entire treaty, but an included letter from President Andrew Jackson gives a summary of the treaty. In his letter, Jackson states that he has a longstanding regard for the Cherokee people and it is his wish that they know his feelings on their situation. He states that living among the white population is destroying their culture and to continue living in their ancestral lands would seal their doom. He refers to their numerous rejections of the United States to relocate though it would mean a better life, and the refusal to relocate has only brought more difficulty to their people. He continues to announce that a delegation of leaders who are favorable to remove have agreed to a treaty, though it must be approved by the full council of the Cherokee Nation, and the Nation is to be removed to a land "with a very fine climate adapted to your habits." Jackson then lists a summary of the stipulations and provisions that were included in the treaty, and the total sum that is to be paid to the Nation and acreage the Nation will receive in the West. He states it is his hope that the Nation will choose to remove and not subject their future generations to the turmoil that fate would bring should they stay.

The Cherokee Council, led by Chief John Ross, ardently opposed the idea of removal. However, in 1835, a minority group of Cherokees supporting removal, known as the Ridge Party, negotiated with the United States without the approval of the Cherokee Council. John F. Schermerhorn served as an Indian Commissioner during the Removal Era and represented the U. S. Government during the negotiations with the Ridge Party. This fraudulent treaty, which became known as the Treaty of New Echota, ceded all Cherokee lands to the United States and allotted two years for the voluntary relocation of the Tribe. The Cherokee Council made several attempts to renegotiate an approved treaty over the following two-year period when the enforced removal began in 1838.

According to Ross, Armstrong believed Ross' house must be located in the center of the property. Ross' concern with his house being in the center of the property is that he would lose a large portion of fields below his ferry.
2115. Path Killer was the last hereditary chief of the Cherokee tribe of Native Americans. John Ross was a member of the Cherokee Council and later became the first elected Cherokee chief.

General Scott states that he does not think an escort is needed because everyone will show orderly behavior. He states that the conductors of the detachments have sworn to keep order among their poeople and punish offenders if necessary. He goes on to say that since August, the good opinion of the Cherokees has not changed and he hopes that opinion will remain the same during their travels. He assures Governor Cannon that a copy of this circular will be distributed to the conductors of each detachment and he is waiting to hear from those groups that have already begun their journey.

2121. During World War I, Americans were transported to the battle front on French trains with boxcars stenciled with a "40/8," denoting its capacity to hold either forty men or eight horses. This mode of transportation was familiar to all who fought in the trenches and was generally considered a very unpleasant experience. John Williams Overton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps on April 2, 1917. On February 4th, 1918 he left the United States for France. On May 31st, he graduated at the head of his class at officers' training camp at Gondremont, France and was stationed on the French front by June 1st.

Throughout the letter, he only identifies his location as "France" and also writes that he is not allowed to tell them anything. He refers to the arrival of the battallion on the 40/8 box cars frequently used to transport American soldiers in France during World War I. He also writes of attending an infantry school in a nearby town and meeting a French woman there and of his concern for his sister's health. He mentions billeting with a local farm family and how eager his company is to get into the fight. This letter is written four months before his death during the Second Battle of the Marne in France on July 18, 1918.
2123. A black-and-white drawing showing Catherine Sevier scaling the log palisade of Fort Watauga to escape attacking Cherokee warriors
2124. The drawing is an illustration from a 1970 book entitled The Overmountain Men, by Pat Alderman. It depicts one of the most dramatic incidents in early Tennessee history. According to contemporary accounts, a number of women had left Fort Watauga (in the Sycamore Shoals area of Northeast Tennessee) in the early morning of July 21, 1776, to milk the settlement's cows. The women discovered a force of Cherokee warriors approaching the fort in a surprise attack. Their cries awakened the men inside the fort in time for them to bar the fort's gates, man the palisade, and repulse the attack. Cut off from the entrance to the fort by advancing warriors, young Catherine "Bonnie Kate" Sherrill -- who was described as tall and athletic -- ran to another side of the fort and attempted to climb the wall. The settler atop the palisade was John Sevier, who reached down to grasp Catherine's hand and pull her to safety. The two were married four years later. Sevier went on to serve six terms as Governor of Tennessee and two terms in the United States House of Representatives. He is generally acknowledged as one of the "fathers" of Tennessee. The illustration itself reveals a good deal about the way white Tennesseans of the mid-20th century perceived the history of early white settlement. It depicts the attacking Cherokee, armed primarily with lances and bows, as throwing themselves against the well-engineered walls of the settler fortress. This imagery draws heavily on the western movies and television programs of the period. In reality the Cherokee warriors would have been armed primarily with flintlock guns supplied by the British and similar to those wielded by the white defenders. After the failure of the initial attack, the Cherokee settled into a two-week siege intended to force the surrender of the white garrison, a strategy that had succeeded against a much larger white garrison at Fort Loudon some fifteen years before. The defeat and retreat of another Cherokee force at the Battle of Island Flats on July 20 probably influenced the Cherokee to break off the siege and retreat before additional white militia forces arrived.
2125. A small sheet of grayish-blue paper with two hand-drawn illustrations: the left one giving a cross-section of the length of cave itself; the right one mapping the location of the cave's two entrances in relation to Mill Creek and the Cumberland River.
2126. The location shown on the map indicates that the cave mapped is the same one used by French-Canadian fur trader Timothy Demonbreun (1747-1826) to hide from hostile Native American hunting parties and to store his trade goods prior to his construction of a trading post above the river bank. The map itself identifies the cave as "Buchanan's Cave." This name may derive from the fact that the cave was located near Buchanan's Station, one of the fortified farmsteads constructed by the early American settlers. According to Buchanan family history, one of this familiy's sons, Samuel Buchanan, was cut off from the safety of the station by a surpise Native American attack. He attempted to reach a cave in order to hide from his pursuers, but injured himself in a leap off a bluff above the cave mouth and was killed. Samuel's father James and brother Alexander were also killed in Native American attacks.
2127. A color photograph of an illustrated book cover portraying Crockett in frontier attire, printed from a woodcut on yellowed newsprint.
2128. Although he lived considerably later than the long hunters of pre-Revolutionary times, David Crockett (1786-1836) is a good example of the long hunter way of life. Throughout his career, which included service in the War of 1812 and terms served in the Tennessee General Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, Crockett would disappear into the Tennessee wilderness on hunting trips lasting several months. Publications like the Crockett Almanac helped make him an example of the American frontiersman in his own lifetime and for many generations after. The image shown is the cover illustration of the 1842 Crockett Almanac, printed in Boston in that year. It presents the popular image of Crockett in frontier dress, holding a muzzle-loading long rifle and standing over a dead predator He is not, however, wearing the coonskin hat featured in later portrayals such as the Walt Disney television series of the 1950s.The Crockett Almanacs were examples of the "comic almanac," a type of humorous publication filled with tall tales, exaggerated descriptions of frontier "characters," and woodcut illustrations depicting dramatic or ridiculous situations. The first Crockett Almanac was published in Nashville in 1835. Between 1835 and 1856, some fifty-five editions were published in a variety of locations. Almost nothing is known about the writers, illustrators, or publishers of the first four editions, the "Nashville imprints" of 1835-1838. Subsequent editions were printed in northern cities such as Boston and Philadelphia. Scholars are reasonably certain that Crockett himself had nothing to do with these publications, and there is no record that he or his heirs ever received any payments from their sales.
2129. A small black-and-white photograph of a rocky bluff with the entrance to a cave in the top center
2130. Timothy Demonbreun (1747-1826) was a French Canadian trader who brought goods to French Lick, the original site of Nashville, to exchange for furs and hides with Native American hunting parties. The entrance to the cave was in the face of a limestone bluff overlooking the Cumberland River. It could only be seen from the river, and not from the land above. Tradition holds that Demonbreun used this cave to hide from pursuing Native American warriors. Other, less romantic accounts suggest that Demonbreun used the cave as a ready-made storage space for trade goods until he was able to construct a log dwelling/trading post on land above the bluff. Demonbreun probably first came to the area in the late 1760s, and was staying in the area when the first Anglo-America settlers arrived to found the Cumberland Settlements in the late 1770s. He subsequently served in George Rogers Clark's post-Revolutionary War campaign against the British-allied Native American nations of the Ohio Territory. Demonbreun was readily accepted in Nashville society after he settled there permanently in 1786. The experiences of the American long hunters would have closely mirrored Demonbreun's youthful travels as a fur trader.
2131. A color photograph of a book cover illustration portraying Crockett as startled by an owl's hooting, printed from a woodcut on yellowed newsprint.
2132. For his contemporaries, David Crockett (1786-1836) served as a latter-day embodiment of a way of life associated with the long hunters of the 18th century. His success as a politician (he served two terms in the Tennessee General Assembly and three in the U.S. House of Representatives) was in large part due to his ability to captivate audiences with humorous tales of his hunting adventures in the great forest that still covered much of Tennessee in the 1830s. The image shown, the cover illustration of the 1840 Crockett Almanac, printed in Boston four years after Crockett's death at the Alamo, is an example of the self-depricating humor that endeared Crockett to his fellow Americans.The Crockett Almanacs were examples of the "comic almanac," a type of humorous publication filled with tall tales, exaggerated descriptions of frontier "characters," and woodcut illustrations depicting dramatic or ridiculous situations. The first Crockett Almanac was published in Nashville in 1835. Between 1835 and 1856, some fifty-five editions were published in a variety of locations. Almost nothing is known about the writers, illustrators, or publishers of the first four editions, the "Nashville imprints" of 1835-1838. Subsequent editions were printed in northern cities such as Boston and Philadelphia. Modern historians assert that Crockett himself had no connection with these publications, and that neither he nor his heirs earned any money from them.
2133. A grayscale plate made from a copy of Sulley's 1774 portrait, apparently torn out of a book, with a lengthy legend below the image and handwritten notes pencilled in above and below.
2134. Daniel Boone was the most famous and influential of the "long hunters" who explored the western reaches of the Virginia and North Carolina colonies prior to the Revolutionary War. These areas became the states of Tennessee and Kentucky in the 1790s. Boone's most famous exploit was to pioneer a route through the Appalachian mountain ranges of eastern Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky that became known as "the wilderness road." This route ran west from Virginia just below the northern border of Tennessee until it reached the Cumberland Gap, where it turned turned north to pass through the Gap into Kentucky. This road was the principal route used by settlers migrating from Virginia and the Middle Atlantic states into the "Bluegrass" areas of Kentucky. The plate shown was used as an illustration for an article on Boone that appeared in the Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, May, 1907 (V. 5, No. 14, p. 38). According to the legend on the page, this portrait of Boone was originally painted by artist Thomas Sulley during Boone's 1774 visit to the colonial Virginia capital at Richmond. The colonial governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, had invited Boone to the city to consult on ways to improve the Wilderness Road and thereby encourage more colonists to settle in the undeveloped western lands of the Virginia colony. The attribution of the painting to Thomas Sully is erroneous, as that artist was not born until 1783.
2135. A handwritten, single-paragraph description of the legendary long hunter and settler.
2136. The handwritten account shown is taken from the papers of Judge John Haywood, whose Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee (1823) is regarded as the first history of our state. Thomas Sharp Spencer was renowned among the early long hunters and settlers of the Cumberland Valley (today's Middle Tennessee) for his size and physical strength. Tradition holds that he acquired the nickname "Big Foot" from his enemies. During the early days of white settlement, Native Americans routinely patrolled the principal trails used by white hunters and settlers to intercept the travelers they regarded as illegal aliens. On one occasion a small group of Native American warriors reportedly picked up Spencer's tracks on a trail and pursued him. When the trail passed through a patch of snow, his pursuers saw the clear imprint of Spencer's very large foot in the snow and gave up the pursuit. A man with a foot so large, they reasoned, would be too large and formidable an enemy. In 1794 Spencer was returning to Middle Tennessee from Virginia when he was shot and killed near the present-day community of Crab Orchard, Tennessee, by a Native American patrol waiting in ambush. Some accounts credit Spencer as the first white to clear land and plant corn in the Cumberland Settlements during an extended (1776-1779) long hunt in the area. As with many other long hunters of this period, including Kasper Mansker, Spencer undertook his travels with the dual purpose of obtaining pelts for sale and finding good land to claim and settle. It was these land claims that would have enabled Spencer, had he survived, to amass the "great fortune" that the Haywood account posits.
2137. A four-page manuscript handwritten in ink on paper.
2138. Kasper Mansker (1750-1820) was one of the few long hunters to leave a record of his hunting travels for posterity. The manuscript shown was found in the papers of Justice John Haywood, author of The Civil and Political History of the State of Tennessee, the first history of our state. It is uncertain whether Mansker wrote this account himself or dictated it to another person, possibly to Haywood. His narrative indicates that on their first hunt in the Middle Tennessee area Mansker and several of his fellow long hunters were familiar enough with the geography of the land to embark on a journey down the Cumberland to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. They then followed the Mississippi all the way to New Orleans, where they sold the hides and meat they had gathered on their hunt. Mansker returned to the Middle Tennessee area several times with different parties before settling there permanently about 1780. He was a signer of the original Cumberland Compact, and played a very active role in the Indian Wars of the 1780s and 1790s, serving as an officer in the militia and participating in the Nickajack raids of 1794. He is reputed to have fought at the Battle of New Orleans as a private soldier in the Second Regiment of Tennessee Volunteer Mounted Gunmen, when he would have been more than sixty years old. He died at his home in Sumner County in late 1820, having traveled and lived in the Middle Tennessee area for more than fifty years from the time he first visited the area in 1768.
2139. Norris Dam was TVA's first in a series of dams that harnessed the wild waters of the Tennessee River system to control floods and provide inexpensive electric power. The dam is 1,860 feet in length and 265 feet in height. On top of the dam is U.S. Highway 441 that measures 22 feet in width.
2140. This article describes the development of the Norris Dam and the engineering and construction efforts to make the dam. The articles featured in the Norris News newspaper are written by and for TVA employees.
2141. As a way to house the workers who constructed Norris Dam, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) created a village with houses, a school and other community buildings. During the 1930s, Norris was similar to a company town where TVA operated practically everything such as the cafeteria, the town's gasoline station and the local auto repair shop. After the dam was completed, the workers left Norris. Professionals who worked for TVA or in Knoxville saw the town as an attractive alternative to city living and Norris gradually turned into a white collar suburb of Knoxville. In June 1948, the federal government sold the town to a private corporation, which resold the individual lots to the residents.
2142. This article provides some insights about the community of Norris that was created to house the workers on Norris Dam. The articles featured in the Norris News newspaper are written by and for TVA employees.
2143. The Chickamauga Dam is located in Hamilton County, Tennessee. It was constructed as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal project known as the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The Chickamauga Dam project was notable for having the highest percentage of African American workers of any TVA project in Tennessee. After it was completed, the Chickamauga Dam was 5,800 feet long, 129 feet high and held 506,400 cubic yards of concrete. In addition to the dam, a lake known as Chickamauga Lake was created with the project. The lake is almost fifty-nine miles in length and contains 35,400 acres and 800 miles of shoreline.
2144. This photograph shows a view of Chickamauga Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.
2145. This map provides details of the construction of the Chickamauga Dam site on the Tennessee River. This map is from the Unified Development of the Tennessee River System booklet produced by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
2146. Douglas Dam is located at the northeast border of Sevier County on the French Broad River. Douglas Dam is 202 feet high and 1,705 feet wide. In order to make the reservoir, Tennesee Valley Authority (TVA) personnel removed 525 families in Sevier, Jefferson, Cocke, and Hamblen Counties. As a result, many rural towns, schools, businesses and homes were destroyed for the construction of the dam and lake. In addition, TVA personnel relocated cemeteries.
2147. This photograph shows a view of Douglas Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.
2148. This photograph shows Norris Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.
2149. Pickwick Dam is located in Hardin County. Construction at Pickwick began on March 8, 1935 and the lake formation began three years later on February 8, 1938. Pickwick Landing Dam rises 113 feet and is 7,715 feet long. Similarly to other TVA projects, the construction of Pickwick Dam affected the lives of five hundred families in Tennessee and northern Alabama and Mississippi. Many of the property owners and tenants in the area were displaced.
2150. This postcard shows the lock at Pickwick Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.
2151. This photograph shows an airplane spraying chemicals in the West Sandy area near Paris, Tennessee. The spraying was part of the TVA malaria control project.
2152. When the Tennessee Valley Authority was incorporated in 1933, malaria affected a third of the population in the region. Death records kept by the Tennessee Valley counties indicated that mosquito borne diseases like malaria and yellow fever took an enormous toll in human life before TVA launched its mosquito-control programs. TVA's response to fighting these diseases was controlling water levels and applying insecticides to help reduce the mosquito breeding sites.
2153. During the 1930s, America was experiencing an economic downturn known as the Great Depression. As a way to help Americans recover, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced his "New Deal" programs. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was founded to help the hard-hit Tennessee Valley, where it was tasked with improving the quality of life in the region. One of the ways TVA improved the area was creating dams and reservoirs on the Tennessee River to control the river's navigation and help with flood control.
2154. This map offers a colorful view of the different dams and reservoirs that were created on the river to control the river's navigation and help with flood control. The map is from the Unified Development of the Tennessee River System booklet produced by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
2155. This photograph shows an aircraft spraying insecticide in the swampy areas to help control the breeding areas of mosquitos.
2156. The Cherokee Dam is located on the Holston River on the boundary between Jefferson and Hamblen counties. As part of the Tennessee Valley Authority's wartime readiness program, the dam was built in a mere two years, with much of the work taking place around the clock. As a result of wartime concerns and budgetary restraints, recreational facilties were not created. However, during the 1960s, local, state and TVA officials eventually created Panther Creek State Park on the east side of the river to boost tourism and economic growth to the area. The Cherokee Dam is 175 feet high and 2,060 feet long.
2157. This photograph shows an aerial view of Cherokee Dam that was created as part of the Tennessee Valley Authority project in the 1930s and 1940s.
2158. The Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area is a United States National Recreation Area located in Kentucky and Tennessee between Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake. The recreation area was originally formed by the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1940s. As a result of the development of a dam, a lake known as Kentucky Lake was formed and flooded some of the low-lying land in the area. Some of the farmers that lived in the area were forced to move to other places. Although the recreation area was managed by the TVA for awhile, it was eventually transferred to the United States Forest Service. The area was designated a national recreation area by President John F. Kennedy in 1963.
2159. This photograph shows a family camping in a tent at TVA's Land Between the Lakes.
2160. Big Ridge State Park was one of five demonstration parks developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in cooperation with the National Park Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) as an example of public recreation development along TVA lakeshores. The structures at Big Ridge State Park reflect the craftsmanship and stonework of the CCC. Today, visitors to the park can do a variety of recreational activities such as hiking, camping, and swimming.
2161. This photograph shows a view of the boat dock and lake at Big Ridge State Park. The image also shows several people boating on the lake.
2162. Prior to the development of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), many rivers in the Tennessee river valley flooded. The development of TVA's system of dams and reservoirs helped control the river's navigation and provided flood control.
2163. This photograph shows the community of Hartsville, Tennessee during a flood that occurred in 1925.
2164. The Cherokee Dam is located on the Holston River in East Tennessee. It was named for the tribe of Native Americans who once inhabited the area. The Cherokee Reservoir is a popular recreation destination. There are many commercial boat docks, a state park and a state wildlife management area for visitors. One popular recreational activity at Cherokee is fishing. At the reservoir, visitors can find a wide variety of fish such as black bass, sauger, walleye, crappie, sunfish, and rough-fish species.
2165. This photograph depicts a man and his son weighing fish at the Cherokee Lake Boat Dock in Hamblen County.
2166. In 1928, the Caney Fork River and its tributaries flooded the Buffalo Valley, Tennessee area. This image shows how the flood impacted the landscape.

2169. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Women's Army Corps was the first women's reserve unit formed during World War II. It was originally created in 1942 as an auxiliary unit, known as the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps. However, when complications arose because of their civilian status in this auxiliary, the unit was changed into a women's reserve of the Army. The Women's Army Corps was the only women's reserve unit, aside from the nursing corps, to station women outside of the United States or U. S. controlled territories of Hawaii and Alaska. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles as civilians. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The Women's Army Corps became a permanent part of the U.S. Army in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.
2170. This small pamphlet was given to women who were being discharged from the Women's Army Corps at the end of World War II. It explains that women who have spent the last few years in the regimented life of the military may find it difficult to readjust to civilian life. It offers tips on how the military or military support organizations, like the American Red Cross, can provide aid to women returning to civilian life. It also advises women on maternity care if they are being discharged because of a pregnancy and suggests women seeking employment contact the United States Employment Service to take advantage of the GI Bill of Rights. It gives information about maintaining the bands they bought while in service. It also reminds women that the skills they learned while serving in the Army can benefit them in the civilian world, thanks them for their service as a soldier and wishes them the best of luck as a civilian.
2171. A promotional booklet for the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. This illustrated booklet describes the heritage of the Marine Corps and the need for women to fill the roles men are leaving open by going to the frontlines. It lists the benefits a Woman Reservist would get and what qualifications are needed to enlist. It describes the pay, rank, enlistment and training processes. At the end, there is a frequently asked questions section. Illustrations include recruiting poster images, drawings to create visuals for the information given, portraits of high-ranking officers of the Marine Corps and the Women's Reserve.
2172. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.
2173. This songbook contains lyrics to 34 songs sung by the Marine Corps and women's reserve branches of the Navy (WAVES), Coast Guard (SPARs) and Marines. The booklet has official songs like the Marines' Hymn and the Star Spangled Banner as well as short, playful songs.
2174. Mary Washington Frazer starts her letter by telling about inspections and a parade for visiting dignitaries. Then she describes the class going to the riverbank on base for a demonstration. She states about 15 male Marines demonstrated different weapons exercises the Marines learn for combat, as well as different types of weapons they use. She also describes their demonstrations of the "amphibian tractor," and how it drove from the water, onto the land, then back into the water and "sailed away." She makes the statements at the end of the letter that these demonstrations were given for the benefit of the visiting officials. This hand-written letter was written on United States Marine Corps stationery.
2175. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The Marine Corps was the only United States military branch that provided any kind of combat training to its Women's Reserve during basic training. The Director of the Women's Reserve believed an introduction to combat training would give the women a better understanding and appreciation for what the men they were releasing for duty would be facing on the front lines. In 1948, with the Armed Forces Integration Act, women were made a permanent part of the military, although combat roles remained officially closed to women until 1994.
2176. Mary Washington Frazer begins this letter by describing a dance she attended with fellow Women Reservists and Coast Guard officers. She thanks her mother for recent letters containing family news and then begins describing two field trips. The first trip was to the Dog Training Detachment where they showed the usefulness of the dogs on the front lines, as attach dogs and as escorts under fire. The second field trip was to the Firing Range where the women were shown how to shoot the carbine. They shot the gun at a target and she tells how accurate she was at shooting. Then she describes the noise of the bullets. She mentions their weather, her hopes for requesting some leave to go to Washington, D.C., and ration coupons. This letter is hand-written on stationery from Marine base Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina.
2177. In her letter, Franklin describes the trails of her new assignment including long hours, difficult grading of exams, and living quarters. She explains that the Marines have been split up among the Navy's Women's Reserve in lodging. She compliments the closeness of the educational campus to several large cities and the recreational facilities. She shares news of fellow Marines, asks Frazer how her leave at home went, and tells her about the new theme song they have adopted entitled, "Take us back to New River."
2178. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. The United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve (MCWR) were authorized in July, 1942, when the Navy created its women's reserve, Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). However, the MCWR was not formed until February of 1943. The Marine Corps was the only WWII women's reserve unit to use the same training curriculum for both men and women, modified only enough to account for differences in gender. At the end of WWII, most of the women who had enlisted were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.
2179. This graduation party invitation provides all of the information about the time and location of the event in the format of military strategic orders for battle. The invitation begins with the General Situation in which it states that the Company C, 6th Basic Class, AGOS, U.S. Marine Corps has maintained its position for eight weeks and has encountered heavy resistance, including "poison ivy, wood ticks, chiggers...." The General Situation claims there is one last stronghold of opposition remaining, located at Hill BOQ, and states orders have been given to make an assault at nightfall to gain control. The invitation goes on in the Special Situation to recount the Commanding Officers orders and plan for attack, providing the order, time and locations for each event of the "assault." The final section of the invitation lists the Requirement, in which it summarizes the invitation information for the party. The document is typed on the front and back of the invitation. On both the front and back of the invitation the original dates state 26 July 1944 but the 26 has been marked out and 24 is written in place of it.
2180. This booklet was designed to provide new United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve recruits arriving at basic training with an introduction to military regulations. It gives them Marine terminology, rules of conduct, explains their living quarters and how they are to be arranged and cleaned, uniforms, classroom procedures, and other information they will need for life on a military base. The booklet has hand-drawn stick figure Women Marines acting out the different sections.
2181. In this letter, Jean Anderson thanks the Frazers for sending a box of chocolates for Christmas and explains she used the gift as a treat for a party she helped host. She mentions that they had been questioning what to serve at the party because Americans were unable to buy food in France and the chocolates arrived just in time for the occasion. She then goes on to describe her latest job with the Red Cross's Civilian War Relief Department in France. She states the Red Cross is working to find a solution to help the thousands of displaced persons who are being liberated as the Allied forces advance. They travel across the country taking supplies to displaced persons camps, often relying on inadequate transportation because the resources were depleted by the Germans. Anderson expresses her admiration for the persistence of the Russian people to continue to fight after the turmoil they have faced at the hands of the Axis Powers. She mentions a letter she received from Preston and the work the 2nd Armored Division is doing in Europe and requests news of the other family members.
2182. The Frazer and Anderson families became acquainted while Colonel George Augustine Frazer was stationed in Hawaii in the late 1930s. After the United States entered World War II, Jean Anderson joined the Red Cross and served overseas in the Civilian War Relief department. Anderson maintained consistent correspondence with the Frazer framily throughout and after the war.
2183. Jean Anderson begins her letter by acknowledging receipt of Sadie's letter and her appreciation of the news from home. She comments on the quality of life for the people living in the combat areas of Europe and how she does not understand how people can still live in such devastated areas. She expresses disbelief of the blind faith of the German people in Hitler's propaganda. She closes her letter by hoping to see Preston soon and feeling comforted knowing he is also in Europe.
2184. Mary Washington Frazer was living in the James Robertson Hotel temporarily with her family while they prepared to move into their new house in Belle Meade. Frazer volunteered to join the Marine Corps in 1943 and received her orders to report in June of that year. Frazer remained in the Marine Corps until her discharge in May of 1946.
2185. This telegram is from G. G. Wheeler, of the United States Marine Corps, to Mary Frazer, ordering her to report immediately to the Nashville Courthouse to be sworn in to Officer Candidate School of the U.S. Marine Corps Women's Reserve. The message gives her the name of the officer to whom she is to report. The original address to which the telegram was to be sent is marked out and replaced with the forwarding information of "James Robertson Hotel" in handwriting.
2186. In this letter, Mary Frazer explains the roles of a night guard and the hours and events of their duty. Then she states they slept for a short time, but the officer of the day woke them up saying there was a patient suffering from insanity that had escaped from the nearby Naval Hospital and they had to go out and be on guard. She describes this guard duty, where they went and who they encountered and what the protocol would be if they found the man. The letter is dated as "Sunday."
2187. Because of the volume of soldiers needed on the front lines during World War II, the United States government allowed women to fill non-combatant positions in the military in order to release as many men as possible for fighting. Every branch of the military incorporated women into their ranks in some fashion. At the end of World War II, most of the women who had enlisted in the military were discharged and expected to return to traditional feminine roles. However, small numbers of women remained a part of each branch and were able to continue their military careers. The MCWR was made a permanent part of the U.S. Marine Corps in 1948 with the Armed Forces Integration Act.
2188. In this letter, Mary Frazer announces that she has received the news of her discharge date, comments that she will miss the Marine Corps, and says she will begin shipping her possessions home. She mentions an ad that she enclosed and asks to know the family's plans for the summer.
2189. During World War II, Mary Washington Frazer was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. After completing her training courses, she was assigned positions at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia as well as Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina. After the war ended, Frazer remained in service for almost a year before being discharged. Because many of the resources needed for the war industry were in limited supply, many products were rationed during World War II, including gasoline. Civilians were given ration books that contain a small number of coupons for a limited amount of rationed products.
2190. In her letter, Mary Frazer refers to her mother's birthday and says she attempted to call the previous night. She expresses disbelief that the war is finally over and wonders when she will be discharged. She states that she heard on the radio that one can go to the gas station and fill up their car without a ration coupon. She admits she was unable to fill without coupons the previous day, but later states that she had interrupted her letter writing to go to the station to get gas.
2191. During World War II, Mary Washington Frazer was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. After completing her training courses, she was assigned positions at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia as well as Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina. After the war ended, Frazer remained in service for almost a year before being discharged.
2192. Mary Frazer begins this letter by comments on the news she received about her brother, Preston. Then she copies a "jingle" she saw on a co-worker's desk that described how she believes everyone will feel by the end of the war. The rhyme discusses wishing one was a rock so as to be lazy and do nothing, and Mary comments that she feels that way a lot. She states that she does not see how men can sustain a working schedule all their lives. She closes with a question regarding her nephew.
2193. During World War II, Mary Washington Frazer was commissioned as an officer in the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve. After completing her training courses, she was assigned positions at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia as well as Camp Lejeune in New River, North Carolina. After the war ended, Frazer remained in service for almost a year before being discharged. Because many of the resources needed for the war industry were in limited supply, many products were rationed during World War II, including gasoline. Civilians were given ration books that contain a small number of coupons for a limited amount of rationed products. In order to supplement their coupons, civilians were encouraged to grow their own vegetables in small "Victory" gardens. George Preston Frazer was Mary Washington Frazer's older brother. Preston was drafted into the Army in 1941 and served in the 2nd Armored Division's Headquarters. He served with the 2nd Armored Division in the European theater, including North Africa, Siciliy, France and Germany. The siblings maintained a friendship with Jean Anderson, a Red Cross worker who served in Europe during the war and relayed news from her family to the Frazers.
2194. Mary Frazer begins her letter describing the evidence of Spring's arrival and commenting on the weather her brother, Preston, might be having in Africa.

The rest of the women are wearing casual dress attire.
2201. World War II was the catalyst that brought change in the gender roles held for women. Because of the labor shortage produced by men joining the armed forces during World War II, women were encouraged to take jobs in nearly every industry. Traditional gender roles had limited the job descriptions of women, but the need for manpower during the war allowed women to extend the boundaries of the work they could perform outside the home. Aviation Corporation (AVCO), with its subsidiaries, was among the top employers of women in Tennessee during the war.

2207. Henry Johnson and Needham Roberts were members of the 369th Infantry, which came to be known as the Harlem Hellfighters and one of the most well known African American units of the war. The American military was segregated during World War I, with black soldiers prohibited from fighting alongside white soldiers. African American soldiers readily joined the military with the hope that their service would lead to better treatment at home. Most African Americans served in labor positions, the 369th Infantry, however, became part of the 93rd Division and then was attached to the French Army. In the summer of 2017, the 369th Infantry was integrated into the French 161st Division. Once combat operations began for the 369th, they distinguished themselves by spending over six months in combat and becoming the first to reach the Rhine.

These soldiers were cited for bravery and were the first Americans to receive the illustrious French Croix de Guerre.
2209. This piece of correspondence from Martin Boyd of Newbern, Tennessee is found in Governor Austin Peay's papers. It references publicity found in the newspaper The Press-Scimitar of Memphis suggesting that Governor Austin Peay received a stimulant in the form of intoxicating liquor when he was ill. Mr. Boyd suggests that the "manner in which this commonplace information is presented arouses suspicion that an attempt will be made to get the prohibition laws modified" and poses the question, "Can it be that the Press-Scimitar desires a return of the 'prescription saloon'?"
2210. With the headline of "Nashville Police Force Pronounced Inadequate", this broadside is critical of the Nashville police force and their handling of enforcement of the prohibition amendment.

2211. Superintendent Andrew Wood states in this letter that he believes "...that the state of Tennessee, with its own laws upholding prohibition, can very well undertake to demonstrate the interest which it has in promoting law and order in its various communities." It is Superintendent Wood's opinion that there should be state officers who can cross county lines to apprehend "rum runners" and "automobile speeders." He references a law enforcement conference held by the Governor and Attorney Generals of the State to discuss the enforcement situation and the President of the United State's comments that "States assume more of their responsibility in the enforcement of the prohibition amendment."
2212. The Prohibition movement was organized in the middle of the 19th century as part of a religious movement. As its popularity increased, several states banned consumption of alcohol. The 18th Amendment (passed 1917, ratified 1919) and the Volstead Act (passed 1920) both supplemented the movement, attempting to ban all alcohol in the United States. The 21st Amendment repealed the Prohibition laws in 1933. The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) organized in Nashville in 1881 and worked to gain ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. Nationwide, the WCTU was the largest anti-alcohol organization.
2213. This document is a copy of a letter sent to the Memphis Press-Scimitar from three women representing the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Halls, Tennessee. The letter denounces the policy of the newspaper The Press-Scimitar in Memphis toward the cause of prohibition and suggests they are on the side of the "wets". The authors reference an article that appeared on the front page titled "Peay, Bone Dry, Given Whisky to Save Life" and proclaim it as propaganda.
2214. Governor Austin Peay writes to the sheriff of Cocke County, Tennessee, Mr. O.L. Hicks, of a strongly worded letter he received from the Honorable A.M. Stack, a judge in North Carolina, concerning liquor coming into North Carolina from Cocke County. Governor Peay quotes the judge in this letter, "It is openly charged that the officers of that city and county make no effort to suppress bootlegging, and it is even charged that some of the officers are in collusion with the bootleggers." Governor Peay reminds Sheriff Hicks that is is required to enforce criminal laws in his county. Governor Peay goes on to say that he is charged to institute and maintain proceedings against any officer who does not enforce the laws where so charged.
2215. The February 25, 1867 act mentioned in the document refers to an act passed by the Tennessee General Assembly to give African American men the right to vote and established the criteria for voting eligibility.

The commissioner of registration for a given county had the final say on an applicant's eligibility to vote.
2216. This voter registration form is executed in Madison County, (Tenn). It states that Stokely Hutchings is a male inhabitant of the State of Tennessee of the age of twenty-one years, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Madison County for six months.

2217. As governor, Malcolm Rice Patterson oversaw creation of the State Highway Commission and led a movement for improvements in public education. With regard to prohibition, the governor was inconsistent with his opinion. During his campaign, he pledged to support the temperance movement but in 1909, he vetoed a bill prohibiting liquor sales within four miles of a school which angered temperance supporters.
2218. Political cartoon that appeared in the Nashville Tennessean newspaper on June 13, 1908.

2277. This manual was produced by the Office of Civil Defense within the U.S. Department of Defense for use by students in the civil defense course "Personal preparedness in the nuclear age." The manual begins by addressing the ideology of communism and Soviet (Russian) technological and military achievements. The manual suggest that world governments are in an "Era of Decision" where each country will have to decide if we are going to enter a era where nuclear developments will be beneficial to all mankind, or if we'll enter a nuclear war. The manual goes on to provide information about nuclear weapons, defensive and protective measures, and personal survival actions.
2278. Letter dated January 30, 1917 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. Writing on stationery from the Union County Woman Suffrage Organization, Smith describes her upcoming position as secretary of the organization. In the letter, she also describes her curiosity with the Tennessee senate and their upcoming vote on suffrage. She questions why there has been a delay in the vote since she believes suffrage is "certainly coming."
2279. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Woman's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women's suffrage.

2284. In 1915, Europe was in the middle of the first World War. At the time, many Americans, including President Woodrow Wilson were hesitant to enter the war, preferring to enact a policy of neutrality and isolation. As war intensified, German submarine attacks on Allied naval vessels increased, making ocean travel more dangerous for passengers. In April 1915, the Imperial German Embassy placed warning advertisements in American newspapers warning American travelers of possible destruction of ships traveling in the war zone. On May 7 1915, the Lusitania crossed in front of the German U-boat, U-20. The U-boat fired a torpedo into the starboard bow of the liner, which caused an explosion in the ship's hull. The ship quickly began sinking and was submerged within 18 minutes of the attack. Crewmembers attempted to launch lifeboats, but the conditions made it difficult and only 6 of the 48 lifeboats were launched. Due largely to hypothermia and drowning, 1,198 of the 1,962 passengers perished including 128 Americans. The loss of American lives to Germany submarine warfare caused an outcry of anger from American citizens.
2285. Letter dated May 9, 1915 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. This letter describes Smith's observations of the war in Europe, relief movements in the United States, and the American public's reaction to the sinking of Lusitania and the impact of the event on the American governent. Smith states that she is "down on war," but doesn't believe her patience will continue if "war provocation" increases.
2286. Letter dated July 29, 1917 to John V. Wright from his presumed neighbor and landlord, Frances O. Smith. In the letter, Smith describes her anxiety over the military draft and wonders which boys from Bolivar will be drafted.

In particular, the pamphlet mentions reaching out to farmers, a constituent group not yet reached.
2288. The League of Nations was an international organization that was a result of the Paris Peace Conference at the end of World War I. It was a precursor to the United Nations. President Woodrow Wilson was a fierce supporter and advocate of the intergovernmental organization, but the United States Senate failed to approve American entry into the League promoted by a wave of disapproval from the American public. The League of Nations dissolved at the end of World War II when the United Nations was formed. The League to Enforce Peace was a similar organization created in 1915 in Philadelphia. The mission of the League to Enforce Peace was to campaign for an international organization for peace. Former president William Howard Taft served as the president for the League to Enforce Peace.

The purpose of the expedition was to gather delegates from non-combatant countries for the purpose of peace mediation.
2291. A letter and following manifesto sent to Governor Rye from T.E. Harre. The letter mentions a manifesto for peace which is attached. The manifesto titled "Manifesto for Neutrality in the Interest of Peace," includes a section of Woodrow Wilson's neutrality proclamation from August 18, 1914. The manifesto describes a group of political, philanthropic, religious, or educational leaders who advocate for peace in the beginning of World War I. Notable men such as William Jennings Bryan, Wilson's secretary of state from 1913 to 1915.
2292. After Europe entered World War I in 1914, the United States government issued a proclamation of neutrality due to a strong desire from the American public, Woodrow Wilson, and other elected officials. On August 4, 1914, Woodrow Wilson publically proclaims the neutrality of the United States.
2293. A letter and platform proposal from the League to Enforce Peace sent to Governor Rye. The proposal details the ways that the League wants to support the League of Nations. Specifically mentioned are ways to reach out to farmer's associations, women's clubs, and religious communities.

2298. In 1899, Chattanooga attorneys Benjamin F. Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead signed an agreement with Asa Candler, president of the Coca-Cola Company, to receive exclusive rights to bottle the Coca-Cola soft drink throughout most of the United States. Not long after, another Chattanooga attorney, John T. Lupton, became the third partner to help finance the first bottling plant in Chattanooga. Over time, the three pioneer bottlers sold bottling rights to local entrepreneurs throughout the United States. By 1909, nearly 400 Coca-Cola bottling plants were operating, most of them family-owned businesses.
2299. This article provides some historical background about the Coca-Cola Bottling Company that was founded in Chattanooga, Tennessee by Benjamin F. Thomas, J.T. Lupton, and Joseph Whitehead in 1898. It offers a brief background of the founders and how they eventually became entrepreneurs in the bottling of Coca-Cola. In addition, the article offers information on the different locations of the Chattanooga bottling plant over the years.
2300. The Roane Iron Company, later headquartered in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was co-founded after the Civil War by John Wilder, a Union officer, who, according to the history of Roane County, Tennessee, discovered an abundance of iron on Walden Ridge and later returned to Rockwood to form the Roane Iron Company.
2301. This image shows the Roane Iron Furnace at the foot of the Cumberland Mountains in Rockwood, Tennessee.
2302. During the nineteenth century, iron making was a big industry in Tennessee. Most of the iron making was done in the Western Highland Rim where all the necessities such as accessible ore deposits, limestone for smelting, wood for fuel, and rivers for transportation were found in abundance. With the increased development of the railroad lines after the Civil War, Chattanooga and other East Tennessee communities also became prominent places for the iron industry.
2303. This article provides some historical background of the iron industry in Tennessee from the 1790s to the period after the Civil War. It offers information on some of the names of prominent iron furnaces that were in Middle Tennessee and East Tennessee and the number of furnaces that were in production during this time period. In addition, the article addresses the emergence of Chattanooga as one of the prominent iron centers in Tennessee after the Civil War. The article also offers insights about the establishment of coal furnaces and ore bloomeries in Western North Carolina and East Tennessee.
2304. During the 1870s - 1900s, America and Tennessee experienced a boom in railroads. Railroads offered a reliable and weatherproof means of transportation for the shipping of goods from one place to another. In Tennessee, the most prominent railroads that formed were the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L & N) and the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad (N.C. & St. L.).  As a result of the development of railroads, Tennessee cities grew into shipping and manufacturing centers. In addition, communities that were on the railroad line became a part of regional, national, and international marketing networks.

2308. During the nineteenth century, iron making was a big industry in Tennessee. Most of the iron making was done in the Western Highland Rim where all the necessities such as accessible ore deposits, limestone for smelting, wood for fuel, and rivers for transportation were found in abundance. With the increased development of the railroad lines after the Civil War, Chattanooga and other East Tennessee communities also became prominent places for the iron industry. One of the companies that developed with the iron and coal industry was the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The company originally was based in Tennessee, it relocated most of its business to Alabama in the late nineteenth century.
2309. This photograph depicts the workers of the Tennessee Iron and Coal Company.
2310. This photograph shows an early Coca-Cola delivery truck in Jackson, Tennessee.
2311. This photograph depicts a train on a viaduct near LaFollette, Tennessee. The LaFollette Coal, Iron and Railway Company was founded by an Indiana based educator and engineer named Harvey LaFollette in the early 1890s. During this time, LaFollette purchased over 30,000 acres of land around Big Creek Gap in Campbell County. LaFollette envisioned a wide-reaching industrial system that incorporated multiple iron and coal mines, a blast furnace, a limestone quarry, coke ovens, and railroads. In 1894, he developed a town named LaFollette and by 1897 he had connected the town to the Southern Railway line. Over time, the LaFollette Coal, Iron and Railway Company became very successful and Campbell County became one of the top coke-producing counties in Tennessee. The wide production of coke ovens was important for a coal mining operation because the coke ovens turned lesser grade coal into a coke, a residue that was crucial in making pig iron. In 1924, the LaFollette Coal, Iron and Railway company's iron furnace closed and the coke ovens were abandoned.
2312. During the nineteenth century, iron making was a big industry in Tennessee. Most of the iron making was done in the Western Highland Rim where all the necessities such as accessible ore deposits, limestone for smelting, wood for fuel, and rivers for transportation were found in abundance. With the increased development of the railroad lines after the Civil War, Chattanooga and other East Tennessee communities also became prominent places for the iron industry. One of the companies that developed during the nineteenth century was the Napier Iron Works. Nearby the iron works was a village of Napier that came into existence about 1890 when the Napier Iron Works was organized and the installation of modern mining and smelting equipment was made. When it was in full production, the company employed 160 men. Sixty of those men worked in the mines, while 100 men worked at the furnace. These men and their families occupied the company houses that they rented for $3.50 a month. Their needs were supplied from the company comissary.  The ironworks operated from 1890 until 1923.
2313. This photograph shows the Napier Iron Works factory and the landscape surrounding the factory.

2315. The Bethlehem Steel Company in its earliest manifestation dates from 1861 when it was initially conceived as the Bethlehem Iron Company located in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania to produce railroad rails. During the 1900s, the company changed its direction and became the Bethlehem Steel Company. Under the direction of Charles M. Schwab and Eugene Grace, the company became the second largest American steel company.
2316. This photograph shows the Bethlehem Steel company factory and some of its workers.
2317. The Bon Air Coal and Iron Corporation was located in White County, Tennessee. It was developed by George Dibrell, a politically powerful Democrat and former Confederate general. In 1882, Dibrell chartered the Bon Air Coal Company with former Tennessee governor John C. Brown as president and Dibrell as vice-president and primary stockholder. To reach Bon Air, the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis railway extended a spur line into White County. The Bon Air Coal Company employed 600 men, including many White County natives, who mined under the supervision of immigrant Scots.

2321. "The summary presented in Table 5 of the state-of-birth data"is in numbers of persons rather than rates. The forty-year intervals between the dates are long enough to represent different generations of migrants. The sixteen states included are the ones with which Tennessee interchanged any appreciable number of migrants. The state ranking is by the number of Tennessee total net migrants each year from the largest number of net in-migrants to the largest number of net out-migrants"" Located on pages 24-25 of "Migration and Industrial Development in Tennessee: A Report to the Industrial Development and Migration Subcommittee of the Tennessee Legislative Council Committee," Oct. 1, 1958, by Robert S. Hutchison.
2322. This chart shows where Tennesseans were migrating to, and who was migrating into Tennessee.
2323. One reason for the Great Migration, aside from economic and educational opportunities, was the racial injustices and racial violence prevalent in the South.
2324. This letter discusses some statistics of lynching in the southern states. It compares the crimes committed with punishments given, particularly commenting on assault. It requests that governors promote and uphold the laws that dictate justice inside and outside the courtroom.
2325. The Local Union writes concerning the problem of unemployment in Tennessee, existing because construction companies refuse to employ "Negro skilled carpenters." In addition they ask the State Labor Department for a minority job opportunity program.
2326. This letter speaks to the racial prejudices in the industrial South against black skilled workers. It also conveys a level of consciousness at the state level of the problems prevalent in labor, particularly with regard to the call for a minority job opportunity program. It shows that black laborers began to have backing with organized labor unions, as well.
2327. In this petition, the citizens of Lake County are requesting help from the government against "lawless" night riders. The night riders are terrorizing the surrounding counties and threatening to come into Lake County to burn farms and drive out all the "negroes."
2328. This is an example of how Southern farms depended on the black population as labor for the well-being of the agricultural economy. The migration north greatly impacted local economy. It also brings focus to the racial violence prevalent in the South which in part instigated the migration.
2329. Although the summary is inclusive (it does not delineate between races), it explains the economic reasons for migration as well as the fallout of such migration in Tennessee.
2330. This chapter is a solid summary of the history of migration in Tennessee over both the first and second Great Migration. Located on pages 63-66 of "Migration and Industrial Development in Tennessee: A Report to the Industrial Development and Migration Subcommittee of the Tennessee Legislative Council Committee," Oct. 1, 1958, by Robert S. Hutchison.
2331. Judge Wells expresses his opinion that the "Work or Fight" order would benefit the war effort both abroad and at home. In doing so, he makes racial judgements regarding vagrants.
2332. This article shows prevelant prejudices against and assumptions about African Americans, identifying them as being "lazy" and "vagrants." The WWI "work or fight" order affected African Americans and farmers on several levels. Farmer/Farm laborers and African Americans were often picked first for the draft. The draft pulled more from the agriculture community than any other laboring business. Farming was not seen necessarily as a legitimate type of labor as compared to industrial labor. For African Americans, the draft provided an opportunity to move up economically. The absence of young white men in factories allowed African Americans not only to migrate to urban centers, but it presented them with economic opportunities in industrial work.
2333. Attorney Estes for the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America appeals to the Tennessee state government with regard to the unemployment of skilled black laborers.
2334. This letter speaks to the racial prejudices in the industrial South and against black skilled workers. It also conveys a level of consciousness at the state level of the problems prevalent in labor. It shows that black laborers began to have backing with organized labor unions, as well.
2335. A group of men in uniform sit outside a tent in a wooded area. Individuals are identified on photograph, narrative on reverse. Colonel William Clinton Tatom & his staff at Reelfoot Lake on an expedition against the Night Riders.
2336. Racial violence in the South was one factor that drove the migration of African Americans to the North and West.
2337. The author discusses the role of railroad companies in immigration. The railroad was a cheap form of transportation that allowed black Tennesseans to migrate from the South. While decreasing the black population in the South, the author notes that railroads are bringing white settlers into the South. In particular, the author notes that railroads are simultaneously solving the "race problem" and the need for more white labor.
2338. Night Rider and victim.  Captions: "Tid Burton - A confessed Night Rider... Burton gave evidence that is proving valuable in the round-up of the men.  H. B. Young - He admits having been whipped by Night Riders operating around Reelfoot Lake."
2339. Night Riders of Reelfoot Lake (ca. 1908).  A violent dispute between local population of Obion and Lake counties and the West Tennessee Land Company over title to Reelfoot Lake and surrounding land. Racial violence in the South was one factor that drove the migration of African Americans to the North and West.
2340. Fifteen men dressed in suits. Six men are sitting. They are outside. Taken from group composite on p. 14 of a 1909 (?) edition of Harper's Weekly.
2341. Trial jury for the cases of the Night Riders charged with the murder of Capt. Rankin at Reelfoot Lake. Racial violence in the South was one factor that drove the migration of African Americans to the North and West.

2348. The advertisement gives African Americans the opportunity for a free college education, if they choose to enter the Students' Army Training Corps.
2349. This advertisement ties in with the "Work or Fight" order. The WWI "work or fight" order affected African Americans and farmers on several levels. Farmer/Farm laborers and African Americans were often picked first for the draft. The draft pulled more from the agriculture community than any other laboring business. Farming was not seen necessarily as a legitimate type of labor as compared to industrial labor. For African Americans, the draft provided an opportunity to move up economically. The absence of young white men in factories allowed African Americans not only to migrate to urban centers, but it presented them with economic opportunities in industrial work. The offer to join the Students' Arm Training Corps gave the addition benefit of providing free college education to African Americans.
2350. The author extols the South and its abundant agricultural society with its "ever-increasing opportunities" and explains a migration of African Americans to the North would cripple the South. However, the writer also states that a migration would solve the "negro problem in the most tragic manner." The article was written by A. Saxon and was first published in the Southern Farm Magazine.
2351. This article gives a glimpse into the complicated relationship between white and black Tennesseans. The presumably white author states that the migration would solve ""the negro problem in the most tragic manner."" In other words, black migration to the north and west would appease white Southerners who felt that they would be better off without the black population. However, the author acknowledges that the absence of the cheap and abundant agricultural labor provided by black Tennesseans would cripple the southern economy. At this point in time, agriculture was still the economic backbone for Tennessee.
2352. Governor Cooper's welcoming address to Camp Campbell.
2353. On March 15, 1943, Governor Cooper visited Camp Campbell to deliver a speech to the 30th Armored Division. The first thing he says, is the men are activated. It's an important date because it is the anniversary of Andrew Jackson's birth. That day is also tax day and Americans were marching to the Internal Revenue to pay for not only being free, but also for the 30th Armored Divison. He ended by saying, "Therefore we armor. Therefore we plan. Therefore we pray."
2354. Camp Campbell was originally built in 1941 as a temporary installation to be used as an armored training center as the United States prepared for war. It was originally given a Tennessee address because of its proximity to Clarksville. Due to the post office being located in Kentucky, it officially became Camp Campbell, Kentucky in 1942. It became home to many divisions such as the 12th Armored Division. On September 12, 1942, Governor Cooper visited Camp Campbell to talk to the 12th Armored Division. In this speech he thanked the men for going to the battle lines and hoped their stay in Tennessee was a pleasant one.
2355. Governor Cooper's address to the 12th Armored Division at Camp Campbell.
2356. Brigadier General Smith, Major General Pritchard, Major General Roderick R. Allen, Brigadier General Jacob McGavock Dickinson, and other unnamed officers watch a firepower demonstration held at Camp Campbell.
2357. Camp Campbell was originally built in 1941 as a temporary installation to be used as an armored training center as the United States prepared for war. It was originally given a Tennessee address because of its proximity to Clarksville. Due to the post office being located in Kentucky, it officially became Camp Campbell, Kentucky in 1942. It became home to many divisions such as the 12th Armored Division and the 14th Armored Division. In 1949, the Eleventh Airborne Division made the camp their permanent home. Camp Campbell officially became known as Fort Campbell in 1950.
2358. Located in Tullahoma, Camp Forrest was one of the largest U.S. Army training bases during World War II. In addition to training, the camp provided logistical support for the Tennessee Manuevers conducted between 1941-1945. On May 12, 1942, the camp became a prisoner of war (POW) camp, making it the first civilian internment camp in the nation. More than 22,000 Germans, Italians, and Japanese were kept there. Prisoners worked all over the camp in various places such as the hospitals, kitchen, bakery, and automotive shop; as well as on several surrounding farms. The last prisoner left on April 13, 1946.

2364. This is a picture of Camp Forrest showing tents, cows, men, and trucks.
2365. The front plate of William Strickland's European architectural sketchbook.  The sketch shows a watercolor drawing of a vine-covered monument with a Latin inscription. The translation reads: "Selected profane and sacred images of Britain and Roman antiquities, suspension bridges; bridges that are modern and bridges in ruins, up to the Trivoli Aqueduct completed in the name of Pope Gregory the Great. Peace be to you."
2366. The sketchbook details sketches made by Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  After several lucrative commissions, he took his wife and two daughters, Emily and Jane, to Europe.  It was an opportune time to go as there were few prospects of obtaining new work.  Because of a financial panic and accompanying labor unrest, no one had the finances or inclination for civil building.  Except for a few Federal commissions, Strickland remained idle for the next several years.  In January 1838, he and his family sailed from Philadelphia for Liverpool, England, and remained abroad for about six months.
2367. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with architecture and antiquities.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Forum Boarium was located on a flat area near the Tiber River between the Capitoline, the Palatine and Aventine hills. It was the cattle forum of Ancient Rome, and the oldest forum in Rome.  The Forum Boarium was the site of the first gladiatorial contest in 264 B.C. Ponte de Rotto, the first all-stone bridge over the Tiber is the remains of an original arch belonging to the Ponte S. Maria, which after two previous collapses was reconstructed under Pope Gregory XIII (before 1575) on the rests of the ancient bridge, Pons Aemilius, built in 179 B.C. It was here the first bridges were built.   A flood in 1598 took away an arch of the bridge. The only piece left during Strickland's visit was "Ponte di Rotto" (meaning "broken bridge"). Ponte Cestia was built in 46 B.C. by the consul Cestius. In 365 A.D., it was almost entirely rebuilt by the Emperor Valens and his sons. The bridge was restored in 1192. The Temple of Portunus, incorrectly known as the "Temple of Fortuna Virilis" (Latin "manly fortune") was dedicated to Protunus, the god of keys, doors, livestock, and warehouses. The temple was built ca. 100 B.C. and restored in the 1st Century. It was converted to a church in 872 and rededicated as the "Santa Maria Egyziaca" (St. Mary of Egypt). The Temple of Hercules Victor (Temple of Vesta) is a round temple of Greek design surrounded by columns. It was once mistaken for a temple of Vesta, but it has been determined to be a temple of Hercules. Hercules was a favorite divinity for traders, so it is appropriate that it would be in this forum. The building was constructed ca. 120 B.C. and is the earliest surviving marble building in Rome. By 1132, the temple had been converted to a church, known as "St. Stephen of Carriages."
2368. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Forum Boarium, Rome, Italy.  Included are sketches of bridges, the Tiber River, and Roman antiquities.
2369. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with archtecture and antiquities.  It was there that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.
2370. William Strickland's sketch of various architectural elements.  Included are corbels, a Norman window, arches and details of columns.
2371. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  In Rome, Strickland was fascinated with Roman archtecture and antiquities.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  He remained in Rome until mid-April 1838.  The Palace of the Lateran (Palace of Constantine) is an ancient palace of the Roman Empire and later a palace of the Popes.  It is the oldest and ranks first among the four great basilicas of Rome.  The site was, in ancient times, occupied by the palace of the family of the Laterani. The palace eventually came into the hands of Constantine, the first Christian emperor, through his wife, Fausta. Constantine gave it to the church in the time of Miltiades, no later than ca. 311. From that time it has always been the center of Christian life within Rome, the residence of the popes and the Cathedral of Rome. Off the left transept of the basilica is the 13th Century cloister, the work of Jacapo and Pietro Vassalletto (ca. 1220-1236), and an example of Cosmatesque art. The columns, as pictured, some plain and some twisted, are adorned with mosaics and have varied capitals.
2372. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the columns in the cloister of Basilica de S. Giovanni in Laterano.  The sketch shows an unfinished drawing and next to it a finished sketch.  Strickland gives a handwritten description of the columns.
2373. After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north through Northern Italy and into parts of Germany and France.  The Tivoli Falls are segmented falls that run beneath the town of Tivoli, then plunge down a wooded hillside below.  The largest segment, the two-tiered Grand Cascata and the segmented Cascatelle are the two main portions of the Aniene Falls.  The tunnels, completed by Pope Gregory XVI in 1835, were the attempts to divert high waters and save Tivoli from seasonal flooding, such as the devastating flood in 1826.
2374. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the "New Falls at Tivoli."  The three segemented falls are pictured in the foreground, surrounded by wooded hillsides near Tivoli.  Strickland gives a brief history of the falls.
2375. In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels he made sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He drew Roman antiquities, medieval towers, and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Temple of Jupiter Stator (Latin meaning "the stayer") was first vowed, traditionally, by Romulus at the critical moment in the battle between the Romans and the Sabines, when Romans had been driven across the Forum valley. This temple was never built, but in 294 B.C., the Consul, Marcus Atilus Regalus, made a similiar vow under similar circumstances in a battle with the Samnites, and erected the temple immediately afterwards. On November 8, 63 A.D., Consul Marcus Tullius Cicero convened the Senate to a meeting in the temple, where he held his first oration against Catiline. The location of the temple is not known with absolute certainty. The written sources give some hint, such as near or just outside of the Porta Magonia, on the higher end of the Via Sacra, or just on the Palatine. When a Medieval tower was demolished in 1827, the ruins of an ancient building appeared, and these remains are frequently identified as the foundations of the Temple of Jupiter Stator.
2376. Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Temple of Jupiter Stator.  The sketch includes the ruins of the temple as well as the remains of archaeological excavations.  The ruins are surrounded by Medieval buildings.  A goat enters the excavation area.
2377. Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, and travelled north.  Radicofani, located between Rome and Florence, may have been one of his stopping places.  The fortress of Radicofani was established ca. 973, and sits on the top of an imposing basaltic cliff from which it dominates the whole territory between Monte Cetona, the Orcia Valley and Monte Aniata.  Initially, Radicofani was under the control of the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Aniata.  Throughout the years the fortress was disputed between the Abbey and the Counts of Aldobrandeschi; it passed under the control of the Counts of Chiusi, part of which they donated in the 12th Century to the Bishop of Siena. The fortress was the center of a war between Ottone IV and the Pope (1210-1214), and then between Firenze and Siena (1229-1235). In 1263, having given shelter to the Siena Guelfi, it was, for the most part, destroyed by the Ghibelline forces. It was during this period that the legendary figure of Ghino di Tacco, a Ghibelline "Robin Hood," made the fortress a base for his adventures. His exploits were recorded by Dante and Boccaccio. In 1559, the fortress became part of the holdings of the Medici family.
2378. William Strickland's watercolor drawing of the fortress of Radicofani, and the surrounding Tuscan countryside.  A small house and a village are shown in the sketch.  Strickland provides a handwritten description of the scene.
2379. After Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled north into Germany and France.  This sketch represents an unnamed suspension bridge on the Saone River in France.  A suspension bridge is one where cables or ropes are strung across a river and the deck is suspended from the cables.  Suspension bridges have towers through which the cables are strung.  Thus, the towers are supporting the majority of the roadway's weight.  The design of the suspension bridge was developed in the early 19th Century. The suspensions in these early bridges were made from chain or linked bars. The bridges on the Saone River were built by order of the French government and the local departments were taxed to defray the costs of construction. The majority of the bridges on this river were constructed between 1830 and 1838.
2380. William Strickland's sketch of the details of an unnamed suspension bridge.  The sketch shows details of the iron suspension cords and a cross-section of the bridge trestles.
2381. The sketchbook is of detailed drawings made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  One of his most ambitious drawings is of the Pont du Gard, an aqueduct in the south of France, located near Remoulins.  Built on three levels, it is 49 meters high, and the longest level is 275 meters long.  Construction began in the middle of the 1st Century A. D.  Its construction is atrributed to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Designed to carry water across the small Gardon River valley, it was part of a nearly 31-mile aqueduct that brought water to the Roman city of Nimes. It was constructed entirely without the use of mortar. The stones, some of which weigh up to 6 tons, are held together with iron clamps. The masonry was lifted into place by block and tackle, with a human-powered treadmill providing the power for the winch. It is believed to have taken about 3 years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers. From the Middle Ages to the 18th Century, the aqueduct was used as a conventional bridge to facilitate foot traffic across the river. The aqueduct was restored in the 18th Century and by Strickland's time, it had become a major tourist site.

2383. The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France, and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.   The Sepulchre of Caecilia Metella is the Appian Way's most famous funerary monument.  The Roman noblewoman to whom the monument is dedicated was related by birth and marriage to two of the most illustrious families of the Republican era.  Her father, Quintus Caecilius Metello had been a consul, defeated the pirate fleets and conquered the island of Crete. Also, her husband had served with Caesar in Gaul from 57 to 51 B.C., and held important high offices. Inside the mausoleum, the funeral chamber is circular and rises from the floor to ceiling in the form of a cone. This is where the urn containing the ashes of the deceased were kept, of which nothing is known. It was converted into a tomb by the Caetani family, who added the pinnacle and built a palace.
2384. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Sepulchre or Tomb of Caecilia Metella.  The sketch shows part of the Appian Way.  Strickland gives a short description of the tomb.
2385. A pen and ink sketch of a transverse view of an embankment on the Great Western Railway.  The sketch shows Strickland's descriptions of the details used in the erection of railroad embankments.
2386. After Strickland and his family arrived in Liverpool in 1838, he traveled to London and visited various engineering friends. He became interested in recent railway and locomotive construction, including the Great Western Railway.  The Great Western Railway was a Bristol (England) Railway Company and a marvel of civil engineering linking Southwest England, the West Country, and South Wales with London.  The Great Western Railway originated from the desire of Bristol merchants to maintain the position of their port as the second port in the country. The company was founded in 1833. Isambard K. Brunel was appointed as engineer of the project. He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself. One of his chief ambitions was to build a railway on which trains could attain high speeds. He used a gauge of 7 1/4 feet, known as the "Broad Guage." He also urged the use of timber instead of stone blocks to support the rails. The first stretch of line from Paddinton London to Taplow near Maidenhead opened in 1838. The railway kept its identity until it became part of British Railways at nationalization in 1948.
2387. The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman antiquities.  The tomb of Nero was located 6 miles from Rome on the Via Flaminia.  Nero was born in 37 A.D., and was the fifth and last emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  He ruled from 54 to 68 A.D.  During his rule, Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy, trade and increasing the cultural capital of the empire. He ordered the building of theaters and promoted athletic games. His reign included a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire (58-63 A.D.). Popular legend remembers Nero as a libertine and a tyrant. Galba's Hispanic revolt of 68 A.D. led to his reported suicide, and the civil war that ensued from his death. The Via Flaminia was a Roman road leading from Rome to Ariminum (Rimini), and was the most important route to the north. It was constructed by Gaius Flaminius during his censorship (220 B.C.). It became the main axis of transportation by which wheat from the Po Valley supplied Rome and central Italy.
2388. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the tomb of Nero.  Also shown is part of a fence and a section of the Via Flaminia.
2389. The sketchbook details sketches made by William Strickland during a visit to Europe in 1838.  Although he traveled in England, France and Italy, he was especially interested in Roman architecture and culture.  He seemed to express some anti-Roman Catholic biases in this sketch.  He also believed that papal influences had a negative effect on architecture.  Pope Gregory XVI (1765-1846), born Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari, was Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1831 to 1846.  Strongly conservative and traditionalist, he opposed democratic and modernizing reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeking to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy. A cardinal is a senior ecclesiastical official, usually a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church and member of the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, "Capuccini Sacerdate", is an order of friars in the Roman Catholic Church, among the chief offshoots of the Franciscans. The order arose in 1520 when Matteo de Bascio, a Franciscan friar, became possessed of the idea that the manner of life led by the Franciscans was not the one which St. Francis had envisioned. He sought to return to the primitive way of life, stressing solitude and penance.
2390. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of Pope Gregory XVI and representative sketches of members of the Capuchin Order.  Also in the sketch is a cardinal receiving a papal blessing.  Strickland provides a description of "Good Friday Services" and a Bible verse.
2391. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  After he arived in Liverpool, he traveled to London, where he visited friends and sketched recent railway and locomotive construction, as well as the famous Crosby Hall.  Crosby Hall stood in a court on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, a short distance from the parish church of St. Helen's.  The hall that remained in the late 18th Century was a part of a large mansion that had been built by Sir John Crosby, a grocer and wool merchant, in the reign of Edward IV. Richard III, as Duke of Gloucester, made the mansion his London home for some time, and William Shakespeare mentions the hall in his play, "Richard III." After the Great Fire of London in 1666, much of the mansion was demolished. Only the Great Hall, and several adjoining chambers remained. Over the years, Crosby Hall was used as offices for the East India Company, as a commercial premises and a meeting hall for Protestant dissenters. The Hall was eventually demolished in the early 20th Century.
2392. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the ceiling of Crosby Hall, London, England, showing the timbers of the roof constructed of oak in a low pointed arch.
2393. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  Strickland was especially interested in Roman architecture and antiquities and highly critical of papal-sponsored architecture.  He visited Rome until mid-April 1838.  Attila (ca. 406-453) was the monarch of the Huns from 434 until his death.  His empire stretched from the Netherlands to the Ural River and from the Danube River to the Baltic Sea.  During his rule he was one of the most fearsome of the Western and Eastern Roman Empire's enemies. He invaded the Balkans twice, besieging Constantinople on the second invasion. He marched through Gaul (modern France) as far as Orleans before being defeated at the Battle of Chalons, and he drove the Western emperor Valentinian III from his capital at Ravenna in 452. Attila is known in Western history and tradition as the grim "scourge of God," and his name has become a byword for cruelty and barbarism.

2397. William Strickland began his tour of Europe in 1838.  During his travels, he visited England, Italy and France.  It was in Rome that he drew the majority of his sketches.  Although critical of Medieval architecture, he found the Roman towers to be "very ornamental and decided embellishment to the architecture of the city."  Strickland wrote that "the towers are 6 to 8 stories in height, built of bricks, the cornices and other projecting parts are also of brick".
2398. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of a Roman tower of the 12th Century.  The sketch includes a detail of the corner of the tower.  Strickland provides a description of a typical Roman tower.

2407. After William Strickland left Rome in mid-April, 1838, he traveled through northern Italy into Germany and France.  The Drachenfels ("Dragon's Rock") is a mountain in the Siebengebirge Mountain range near Bonn, Germany.  The castle ruin on top bears the same name.  One German legend recounts that Siegfried killed a dragon living in a cave in the mountain.  After taking a bath in its blood, he became invulnerable.
2408. William Strickland's sketch of the Drachenfels, showing the mountain and the castle.  In the foreground is the Rhine River.
2409. In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels, he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.  He sketched Roman antiquities, medieval towers and Renaissance St. Peter's.  His impressions of this visit to Rome appeared in a series of eleven articles which were published in the Nashville Daily Orthopolitan in 1846.  He was critical of popes as architects and of archaeological legends.  Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, traveling north through Italy and Germany. The Basilica of St. Peter ranks second among the four major basilicas of Rome. It is the most prominent building inside the Vatican City. Possibly the largest church in Christianity, it covers an area of 5.7 acres and has a capacity of over 60,000 people. One of the holiest sites in Christendom, it is, traditionally, the burial site of St. Peter, first Bishop of Rome. Construction of the basilica began on April 18, 1506, and was completed in 1626.

2412. William Strickland's watercolor sketch of the Basilica of St. Peter, Rome.  Strickland gives handwritten descriptions and dimensions of the building porticoes.  He describes the dome as being "decidedly ugly."
2413. The Pantheon was begun in 27 B.C. by the statesman, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. It was completely rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian sometime between 118 A.D. and 128 A.D., with alterations made in the early 3rd Century by the emperors, Lucius Septimius Serverus and Caracalla. It is a circular building of concrete faced with brick, with a great concrete dome rising from the walls and witha  front porch of Corinthian columns supporting a gabled roof with a triangular pediment. Beneath the porch are huge bronze doors 24 feet high, the earliest known examples of this type. The Pantheon was dedicated in 609 A.D. as the Church of Santa Maria Rotunda or Ad Martres, which it remains today. In 1838, Strickland began a tour of Europe.  Throughout his travels he made some sketches, but the majority of his drawings were done in Rome, where everything interested him and aroused his curiosity.

The Tomb of Cestius is an Egyptian-style pyramid in Rome, near the Porta San Paolo and the Protestant Cemetery. The pyramid is a funerary monument built about 12 B.C. as a tomb for Caius Cestius, Roman praetor, tribune of the people and member of one of the four religious corporations (the Septemviri Epulonum). It is of brick-faced concrete, covered with slabs of white marble. In the 3rd Century, the pyramid was included in the Aurelian Walls, close to the Porta San Paolo, one of the Southern gates. Porta San Paolo is flanked by two cylindrical towers and has two entrances. Near Porta San Paolo, alongside the Pyramid is the Protestant Cemetery, a burial place for non-Catholics. The most famous graves are those of the English poets, John Keats (1795-1821) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822).
2418. Strickland's watercolor drawing of the Tomb (Pyramid) of Caius Cestius, showing the pyramid in the foreground.  Also shown are the Roman walls, and the Porta San Paolo gates.  Also in the foreground is the Protestant Cemetery.  Strickland provides a handwritten descsription of the sketch.

2421. After Strickland left Rome in mid-April 1838, he traveled north through Northern Italy and into parts of Germany and France.  This unnamed suspension bridge was located near the town of Chalons sur Saone in central France and a part of the Burgundy region.  It is located on the Saone River, and in Strickland's time was a well known river port.  There were 13 suspension bridges across the Saone between Chalons sur Saone and Lyons, varying in their span from 180 feet to 360 feet.  These

2432. Presumed birthplace of President Andrew Johnson in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Johnson is said to have been born in this house on December 29, 1809, at its original location on Fayetteville Street.  In 1909, the Colonial Dames of America purchased the house and presented it to the City of Raleigh.  It was later relocated to the grounds of Raleigh's Mordecai Historic Park.  A duplicate of the building is located at the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site in Greeneville, Tenn.
2433. There is some doubt among historians as to whether this building is the true birthplace of President Johnson. A published interview with Mrs. Susan Stewart by Union Army officers in 1865 indicated that the true birth residence of Johnson had been lost to demolition many years before.  Mrs. Stewart recalled that she knew Johnson's parents, who had lived on her family's property on Fayetteville Street, and said she had been asked by Andrew's mother, Polly Johnson, to name the child at his birth.
2434. In his third in a series of four amnesty proclamations, President Andrew Johnson issued pardons for former Confederates, including Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, on July 17, 1868. Many scholars have argued that Johnson's motives to appeal to Southern politicians in his attempt to curry favor prior to the Democratic National Convention was a plan to get him renominated for president.  This pardon would become controversial due to Forrest's war record and involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.

3200. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Woman’s League for the Rejection of the Susan B.

3203. This broadside outlines reasons why anti-suffragists opposed the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. They stated that the interests of women and men were generally the same, and that women were not ""suffering from any injustice"" that having the vote would change. They also believed that women and men had different duties in the government, as they did in the home, and that the woman suffrage movement was a ""backward step in the progress of civilization.""
3204. Jilted for the vote? The anti-suffragists predicted the demise of marriage and motherhood if women were given the right to vote.  Here, a man returns home to find his two daughters deserted by their mother who is out campaigning for suffrage.
3205. Scrapbook page containing a photo of anti-suffragists with a Confederate veteran at their headquarters at the Hermitage Hotel in August 1920. The caption reads: ""Truth crushed to the Earth will rise again"" - is illustrated in this lovely picture of Mrs. Jas.

Calhoun - unfurls the Confederate flag as emblematical of Southern States Rights fight for the defeat of the Federal Amendment; to her left sits the veteran who ""fought and bled"" for Tennessee's States Rights; standing to his left, holding the flag of the Union, is Miss Josephine A. Pearson, Pres. of the Tenn. Division of the Southern Women's Rejection League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, who led the fight in Tennessee which became the BattleGround of the nation. August 1920.
3206. This humorous anti-suffrage broadside makes claims such as ""a vote for federal suffrage is a vote for female nagging forever."" Women's suffrage would masculinize women and feminize men, leading to a collapse of male ascendency, causing the degeneration of the nation. The effective political cartoon shows a hen with a ""Votes for Women"" sash leaving her eggs behind, telling the rooster to ""set on them yourself, old man, my country calls me.""
3207. This broadside for a mass meeting at the Ryman to ""Save the South"" from the Susan B. Anthony (19th) amendment and federal suffrage force bills was a hurried effort to rally anti-suffrage supporters at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville. Among listed speakers were Oscar Underwood, Ruffin Pleasant, E. B. Stahlman, Charlotte Rowe, Frank Bond, and Gus Dyer, with Mrs. Thomas Malone Jr. singing and Judge J. C. Higgins presiding.
3208. This political cartoon features a woman carrying two buckets and dressed in clothing typical of domestic workers. She is standing at the bottom of a ladder with several rungs which are labeled with historically traditional roles of women in society. As one moves up the ladder, the rungs show the types of jobs available to women as time moves forward. At the bottom of the ladder are rungs labeled ""Slavery"", ""House Drudgery"", and ""Shop Work."" Midway up the ladder, near a marker labeled ""Equal Suffrage, are rungs with jobs in ""School Affairs"", ""Church & Charities"", and ""War Workers"". At the very top of the ladder shows positions such as ""Executive"" and ""Legislative"" with the very top of the ladder showing a rung for the ""Presidency."" The cartoon is meant to convey a message that with the passage of the 19th amendment, many more opportunities are available to women.
3209. Leaders of this organization contacted Governor Roberts to urge him to oppose the ratification of the 19th Amendment because it would deprive other states of the right to ""manage their own affairs.""

The letter was signed by Thomas Cadwalader, the secretary of the organization. It included a copy of a letter that the organization sent to every member of the Tennessee General Assembly stating their rationale for opposing the 19th Amendment.
3210. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Carrie Chapman Catt (1859-1947) was president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She came to Nashville during the summer of 1920 to support the efforts of Tennessee suffragists. Her leadership was a key factor in Tennessee becoming the ""Perfect 36,"" the state that put the 19th Amendment over the top.
3211. Uncle Sam celebrates the ratification of the 19th Amendment with his Lady Suffrage.
3212. In this cartoon celebrating the passage of women's suffrage in Tennessee, a woman from the suffragists basketball team, wearing 'Tennessee' on a ribbon around her head, shoots a basketball over a woman from the anti-suffragist team.

3213. This political cartoon from the New York World shows a young woman suffragist asking Colonel Tennessee, the rustic older gentleman often used to represent Tennessee, for a special session of the Tennessee Legislature for the ratification of the 19th Amendment for women's suffrage.
3214. "The Sifter" sorts pro-suffrage and anti-suffrage politicians through the sieve of the 19th Amendment. In this cartoon, the suffrage legislators are doomed to political extinction. Tumbling to the ground are such famous men as President Woodrow Wilson, future President Warren G. Harding, former President William Howard Taft, and future Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.
3215. This pro-Democrat cartoon congratulates the Tennessee party for enacting suffrage. It fails to recognize that Harry Burn, who cast the deciding vote, was a Republican. The donkey and elephant still symbolize the Democratic and Republican parties.
3216. This political cartoon shows a harried Colonel Tennessee on a sofa, his hat on the floor, upturned with its brim labeled 'Tennessee Legislature.' Two young women sit on either side of the Colonel, vying for his attention. One represents 'suffrage' and the other 'anti-suffrage.' A sign tacked up on the wall behind them says 'Special Session,' as the legislature of Tennessee was meeting at the time to decide upon the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Henry Romeike, Inc. of New York, NY provided this clipping to Carrie Chapman Catt.
3217. The Constitution requires 3/4 of the states to ratify an amendment proposal before it becomes law. In 1920, thirty-six states comprised that magic number. Tennessee became number 36. Her belt ""Tennessee"" cinches her waist while she exclaims ""Oh! Colonel!"" This political cartoon contains a double entendre. A Southern colonel, often referred to as ""Colonel Tennessee,"" admires Tennessee's Perfect 36, an allusion to her figure.
3218. This political cartoon illustrates the constitutional controversy that ensued after the Tennessee legislature ratified the 19th Amendment. A teacher with a desk labeled ""National Woman Suffrage"" has her partially eaten apple, labeled ""Ratification,"" stolen by a misbehaving boy from Tennessee, who exclaims, ""I didn't give it to ya ta keep!"" Behind the teacher, there is a Roll of Honor of the 36 states who had ratified the 19th Amendment on which number 36, Tennessee, is crossed out. Henry Romeike, Inc. of New York, NY provided this clipping to Carrie Chapman Catt.

3228. This political cartoon shows two suffragists wearing ""Votes for Women"" sashes, standing outside the Tennessee legislature while it's in special session about the ratification of the 19th Amendment on Friday the 13th.

3236. Anti-suffrage talking points include the declaration "Government is MAN'S work."
3237. The Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment issued this declaration of principles.

3238. In this broadside, the anti-suffragists proclaimed that they sought to separate women from the grunge of politics and advance the ideals of patriotism, morality and Americanism.
3239. Based on an editorial from the New York World, this anti-suffrage handbill exclaims that half the country is already corrupted by some form of "harem government, or those which allow women to vote. The anti-suffragists believed that a small minority of women were imposing their will on the American people."
3240. Anti-suffrage broadside with an image of three African American women and text asking, ""How many of these will your county and state produce, under federal suffrage?""
3241. The Truth about wage-earning women? Anti-suffragists accuse the suffragists of stretching the truth about how the vote will empower female wage earners.
3242. This broadside proclaims that the 19th Amendment will never be ratified if Tennesseans guard their rights. It emphatically states that the Tennessee constitution probihits the ratification of any federal amendment until a new legislature is elected. It further claims that only the United States Supreme Court can declare that the Tennessee constitution is in conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Those who try to circumvent this provision are accused of being lawbreakers who should be impeached, and who are no better than the ""BOOTLEGGER and the BOLSHEVIST."" The message urges citizens to fight the suffragists attempts to override the Tennessee constitution by organizing mass meetings and circulating petitions.
3243. This broadside, published by some unattributed opponent of women`s suffrage, warns Southern men of the threat to states` rights if women attain the right to vote.

It contains excerpts from ""The Negro and the New Social Order,"" which had been printed in The Messenger, published by A. Phillip Randolph as the ""only radical Negro magazine in America.""
3244. This newspaper clipping contains a warning from the anti-suffragists to those who have accused them of being paid by ""liquor interests."" It emphatically refutes any connection to or payment from liquor interests, and claims that Susan B. Anthony herself had appealed to the United States Brewers` Association. The message threatens legal action against libel or slander, and lists the names of Judge John R. Tyson and Hon. Everett P. Wheeler as the general counsel to the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment and the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, respectively.
3245. This broadside, published by anti-suffrage forces in Nashville during the struggle for the ratification of the 19th Amendment, details racial reasons for their opposition to women`s suffrage. It claims that women`s suffrage must be defeated for the sake of Southern civilization, womanhood, and both the white and black races. It lauds the racial harmony of the South, and warns that giving women the right to vote will only spark political competition between the sexes and between the races. There is a detailed accounting of the population of southern states, broken down by race and sex, showing a white majority in all states except South Carolina and Mississippi. An enumerated list of facts purports that the 19th Amendment will create a ""Negro majority"" in South Carolina and Mississippi, where no such ""real majority"" exists now. The amendment will also create a ""Negro majority"" in over 200 counties in the South.
3246. Anti-suffrage activists created this broadside from an article by James Callaway printed in the Macon (Ga.) Telegraph to defend to the reputation of General Robert E. Lee, and to demonstrate the malicious nature of suffrage propaganda. Calloway and many southerners believed that Susan B. Anthony and those who compiled the ""Official History of Suffrage"" had slandered Lee by claiming that he had driven his daughter, Anna Carter Lee, from home because she supported the ""national cause."" Calloway included a letter from Mary Custis Lee, the only surviving daughter, to refute the story. Mary wrote that Annie died of typhoid fever in 1862 in North Carolina, in the arms of her mother. She had never been driven from her home by her father. Callaway stated that ""the compilers saw fit for political purposes to fabricate visious slander against General Lee and his family.""
3247. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history.

After the passage of the 19th Amendment, she became dean of the Southern Seminary of Virginia.
3250. Anne Dallas Dudley was a national and state leader in the fight for women's suffrage who worked tirelessly to secure the ratification of the 19th Amendment in Tennessee. She was from a prominent Nashville family, and married to one of the founders of the Life and Casualty Insurance Company. This picture of Dudley reading with her children Trevania and Guilford, Jr. was used in women's suffrage publicity materials to counter the stereotypes of suffragists as mannish, childless radicals intent on destroying the American family. The historical marker erected by the Tennessee Historical Commission at Centennial Park in Nashville states that ""Anne Dudley played a significant role in the ratification of the 19th Amendment by the State of Tennessee. A native of Nashville, she served as president of the Nashville Equal Suffrage League, 1911-15; president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association, Incorporated, 1915-17; and as vice president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, 1917. May 1, 1916, Anne Dudley walked from downtown Nashville to Centennial Park to demonstrate her support for the right of women to vote.""

Women flood the gallery and floor as the clerk counts the votes.  Young Senator Harry T. Burn from McMinn County cast the deciding vote for the 19th Amendment.  With this vote, Tennessee became the 36th and deciding state to approve the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote. [See Newspaper-0002]
3254. The lyrics of this song lament the changes wrought by women's suffrage. The suffragette is portrayed as being ""trapped in the politician's net"" for Carrie Catt and Alice Paul. Her pure thoughts and poise had been replaced by course talk, and thorns left where roses grew. ""The proud south hangs her head in shame. . . Oh suffragette, you've tolled the bell, now wear the pants and work like hell.""
3255. The broadside highlights the positions espoused by President Woodrow Wilson and the Democratic and Republican parties on the women's suffrage issue. The primary theme is that suffrage for women should originate in state action, rather than a federal amendment.
3256. Harry T. Burn was a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from Niota, in McMinn County. Elected at the age of twenty-two, he became the youngest member of the state legislature. Burn voted with anti-suffragists on a motion to table the ratification resolution for the 19th Amendment that would grant women the right to vote. That vote resulted in a 48-48 tie. When the roll call vote came on the amendment, Harry T. Burn heeded the plea in a letter from his mother, encouraging him to support ratification, and voted yes, effectively breaking the tie. Speaker Seth Walker also changed his vote, planning a parliamentary maneuver to enable the House to reconsider the resolution. Burn's vote provided a 49th vote, and Walker's gave the amendment its 50th vote and the constitutional majority needed for ratification.
3257. E. H. Crump, chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee and County Trustee of Shelby County wrote to State Treasurer Hill McAlister to encourage him to use his influence with the governor to call an extra session of the state legislature upon the question of women paying poll taxes. He was concerned that ""a large negro population in West Tennessee, and particularly in Memphis and Shelby County"" would give the Republicans a ""large and dangerous vote down this way"" if negro women voted. Crump stated that the extra poll tax revenue would be more than enough to pay for the cost of a special session of the legislature.
3258. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Hill McAlister (1875-1959) was an influential Democratic politician from Nashville. He served two terms in the Tennessee State Senate (1911-1915), on the Democratic Executive Committee (1918-1920), as state treasurer (1919-1927), and as governor of Tennessee (1933-1937).
3259. Senator Kenneth McKellar wrote to State Treasurer Hill McAlister to encourage him to support the proposition that two women from each Congressional District be designated as associate members of the state Democratic Committee. He also stated that Democrats should make the most of woman suffrage and that ""our Party could take the lead in this very vital matter.""
3260. Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association who campaigned for the 19th Amendment in Tennessee, wrote to Tennessee legislators to persuade those that feared that voting on the suffrage amendment during the special session would violate their oath to the constitution of Tennessee. She explained how the United States Constitution provided guidance for situations when a state constitution conflicted with the federal constitution by citing Article 6, Section 2: ""This Constitution shall be the Supreme law of the land, and judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."" Catt underlined that last phrase for emphasis. She further stated that Attorney General Thompson had rendered the opinion to Governor Roberts that legislators had the right to vote for the amendment. Acting Federal Attorney General Frierson had rendered a similar opinion to President Wilson.
3261. One of many letters in the collection from Tennessee legislators sent to Senator John C. Houk at the Hermitage Hotel in response to his telegram gauging their opinions on the legality of voting in a special session on the 19th Amendment. Rep. Millican felt that voting would violate the state Constitution. ""Women of Tennessee can vote --why chance the game? Will probably be over, but disgusted with the whole affair."" The suffragists wrote on this copy ""Doubtful"" indicating the view of the likelihood of Millican supporting the ratification resolution.
3262. Colonel Luke Lea, president of the Nashville Tennessean, wrote to Carrie Chapman Catt to inform her he was not the best person to influence four members of the Tennessee House of Representatives that Governor Albert H. Roberts said that he could sway to support the suffrage amendment. Lea resented this ""bungling piece of stupidity, inspired by spite, on the part of the Governor,"" and assured Catt that he had found someone else to speak with those representatives, and that the success of her cause was ""near to his heart.""
3263. Governor Albert H. Roberts wrote that the state Constitution says that ""an amendment of the constitution of the United States must be submitted to a General Assembly elected after the submission is made by the Congress. Our General Assembly was elected last November; hence it could not act upon this amendment if called in extra session."" The following year, Gov. Roberts called the legislature to a special session to vote upon the 19th Amendment.
3264. Sarah Woodall, a court and convention reporter from Jackson, wrote that she would be glad to serve on the committee of 100 women to ""do everything possible to secure votes for the ratification of the Suffrage Amendment."" Woodall stated that the members from Madison County were for suffrage, and asked Kate (Mrs. Leslie) Warner to send her some suffrage literature. She said that she had read some of the antisuffrage literature and found it ""disgusting to the extreme, appealing always to racial prejudice.""
3265. In this unidentified newspaper photograph, Governor Albert H. Roberts signs the Tennessee certificate of ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote.
3266. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Albert H. Roberts (1868-1946), served as a single term governor of Tennessee from 1919-1921. Roberts hesitated to call a special session of the General Assembly to consider the ratification of the 19th Amendment, in part because many legislators maintained that voting on the resolution in special session would violate their oath to the Tennessee constitution. Rulings from the Attorney General, and pressure from the national Democratic Party, particularly from President Woodrow Wilson, persuaded Roberts to support the special session and the ratification of the 19th Amendment. Though Roberts won national acclaim for his support of women's suffrage, many conservative Tennesseans were outraged. His support for women's suffrage was one reason for his defeat in the 1920 gubernatorial election by Republican Alfred Taylor.
3267. Josephine A. Pearson, the president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, wrote to Governor Roberts on behalf of the ""majority silent: of Tennessee women who oppose women's suffrage. She thanked him for his dignified position as a southern statesman. She expressed hope that they could read between the lines about his position on the suffrage amendment, ""an outgrowth of abolition."" The note is upon organization letterhead and marked personal. It accompanied an official letter related to the Dixie Highway Association (not included here), for which she was the president of an auxiliary chapter.
3268. Hal H. Clements, the chairman of Tennessee Republican State Committee called upon the governor to call special session of the legislature for the purpose of ratifying the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which would grant equal suffrage to women of the United States. He stated that the ""Republican party in the nation and in the state has always led the fight for equal suffrage and other progressive measures"" and he anticipated a solid Republican vote in support of the suffrage amendment. In the event that a special session was called, Clements also urged the governor to call for the repeal of the ""infamous Public Utilities Law"" and a repeal or modification of a tax assessment law. He informed Governor Roberts that he was providing a copy of the letter to the press, and requested an immediate reply so that Roberts' reply could be published also.
3269. President Wilson wrote to ask Governor Roberts to call a special session of the Tennessee legislature in order to consider the women's suffrage amendment. He noted the recent Supreme Court decision about a case in Ohio that dealt with a similar constitutional requirement about special sessions. That decision made it possible for the governor to call the special session. Wilson wrote, ""Allow me to urge this very earnestly."" Governor Roberts replied two days later. See also image 42488
3270. Governor Roberts responded to President Wilson's telegram [See also image 42487] to state that he ""heartily favor ratification [of the] 19th amendment"" and would include the subject if the ""legal department advises ratification can now be made."" Roberts also mentioned fiscal issues that must be included in a special session, noting that those opposing the financial platform ""seek to embarrass the party in every way.""
3271. Governor Roberts sent this urgent telegram to President Wilson to ask him to send a congratulatory message to the Tennessee Legislature. Roberts correctly feared that anti-suffragists planned to force a reconsideration of the ratification vote of the 19th Amendment. President Wilson responded. See also image 42485
3272. In response to a telegram from Governor Roberts [See also image 42486], President Wilson sent this congratulatory message from the White House to the Tennessee legislature for ratifying the 19th Amendment. He wrote that he believed that he was ""speaking the voice of the country at large.""
3273. Sue Shelton White, chairman of the Tennessee branch of the National Woman's Party, earnestly requested that the governor issue a proclamation for a special session of the state legislature to ratify the 19th Amendment so that women can vote in upcoming congressional and state primaries in August 1920. Note that this telegram was sent at 2:31 a.m. See also image 42484
3274. Anne Dallas Dudley, a socially prominent Tennessee suffragist, wrote to ask Governor Roberts to call for a special session to only last three days in late July, noting that ""militants are embarrassing the party."" Dudley was president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association from 1915-1917, and was elected as third vice-president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1917. see also image 1286
3275. Alice Paul, president of the National Woman's Party, wrote on behalf of the organization to congratulate Governor Roberts on his ""splendid fight for ratification"" and to express her appreciation for his work for the enfranchisement of American women.
3276. The Rotogravure Section of the Tennessean featured photographs of suffrage leaders including Carrie Chapman Catt, Elsa McGill, and Kate (Mrs. Leslie) Warner. Politicians such as Governor Albert H. Roberts, Representative Joe Hanover of Memphis, Representative Simpson of Humphreys County, and Representative Harry T. Burn holding a sheaf of congratulatory telegrams in his hand. Burn famously changed his vote for suffrage after receiving a letter from his mother in Niota encouraging him to vote for the 19th Amendment. A photograph of Seth Walker, Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, has been cut from the page.
3277. This special page of The Tennessean featured photographs of both suffrage and anti-suffrage advocates at the Tennessee State Capitol the day the state senate approved the resolution to ratify the 19th Amendment. Among the pro-suffrage leaders are Anne Dallas (Mrs. Guilford) Dudley, U.S. Senator Kenneth McKellar, Tennessee Speaker of the Senate Andrew L. Todd, Charl Williams and Abby Crawford (Mrs. George Fort) Milton. Anti-suffrage leaders featured included Josephine A. Pearson of Monteagle, Mrs. James A. Pinkard of Montgomery, Alabama and Charlotte Rowe of New York.
3278. Josephine A. Pearson, president of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, wrote to Seth Walker, Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, to request a hearing before the General Assembly on the suffrage amendment. She was convinced that suffragists were afraid of public discussion and wished to ""smother all hearings rather than have the General Assembly hear BOTH SIDES."" She sent a similar letter to A. L. Todd, Speaker of the Senate.
3279. Josephine A. Pearson, president of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, wrote to A. L. Todd, Speaker of the State Senate of Tennessee, to request a hearing before the General Assembly on the suffrage amendment. She was convinced that suffragists were afraid of public discussion and wished to ""smother all hearings rather than have the General Assembly hear BOTH SIDES."" She sent a similar letter to Seth Walker, Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives.
3280. Photo from scrapbook with caption that reads: Front or Outer office of Anti-Ratification Headquarters, Hotel Hermitage, Mrs. Morgan Brown, Executive Chairman, standing at the Entrance. Seated [are] many prominent Nashville women, who faithfully served their state in detachments, day and night, during August 1920. Standing in the rear at the Entrance to the inner office of the President and Vice-President, Miss Josephine A. Pearson and Mrs. George A. Washington, respectively; is Mrs. Jas. Pinkard, President General of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. To her right, in the center, is Miss Charlotte Raine, field Speaker of the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage; near her to the right, is Mrs. Aspy of Boston, Field Organizer of the National Association.
3281. E. H. Crump, chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee and County Trustee of Shelby County wrote to State Treasurer Hill McAlister to about the recent election which he felt would make the state legislature ""strongly Democratic as usual."" He strongly believed that women not paying a poll tax hurt the Democratic party, because ""so many of them in East Tennessee and negro women in other sections of the state . . . carried Tennessee into the Harding column. I was never so certain in all my life as I was that with woman suffrage and no poll tax provision, it would be harmful to the Democratic party.""
3282. Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association who campaigned for the 19th Amendment in Tennessee, wrote to Governor Roberts after his defeat for re-election for governor in 1920. She noted that Democrats across the country had lost in the Republican landslide, though she was surprised that staunchly Democratic Tennessee had fallen. She expressed her regret that he had suffered for his ""righteous act."" She said that he had ""made a place in history which no man or party can take from you. By an honorable, brave act . . . your call of the Legislature enfranchised the women of the Nation. Nothing can ever take away the glory of that act, and you know it is our American custom to throw stones at the benefactors of progress and build monuments to them afterwards.""
3283. After Mrs. Katherine (Leslie) Warner shared a letter from Carrie Chapman Catt with Governor Albert H. Roberts, he wrote to Catt to explain his opinion of the complicated political situation in Tennessee. He warned that those ""now assuming the act for your movement are antagonistic to me"" and that the 19th Amendment would not be ratified in Tennessee without his support. Abby Crawford Milton, the leader of the non-partisan League of Women Voters, was the wife of George Fort Milton, the owner of a daily newspaper that maliciously ""daily misrepresents"" him for political reasons, and thus, would not be the best choice to lead the suffrage movement in Tennessee. Roberts noted that Mrs. (Catherine Talty) Kenny was the appointee of Mrs. Milton and will do her bidding. His friends would not support the suffrage movement if it is to be used as an instrument of his political destruction. On the other hand, Mrs. Warner was a ""pioneer Suffragist"" and ""a lady of culture and refinement"" who enjoyed ""the confidence of all of the Democrats of the State."" Katherine Warner had served as the first president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, and was Robert's choice to lead his appointed Ratification Committee. In contrast, Mrs. Milton's organization had little strength in the state. Since they had been asked to ratifiy the suffrage amendment with the argument that it would help the party, it made no sense to turn the movement over to a non-partisan organization. The State Democratic Committee would officially endorse Mrs. Warner's suffrage organization, and he trusted that he would ""not be compelled to antagonize your organization in this fight."" He closed by stating that the letter was in strict confidence, and not for publication.
3284. Lon A. Scott, a candidate for Congress in the 8th District from Savannah, affirmed his a support of the suffrage amendment. ""I am not a recent convernt; I lead the fight for the ""limited Suffrage Bill"" when it passed the house in 1917.""
3285. The League of Women Voters asserted in this proclamation that the women of Tennessee should be treated equally with men in the matter of suffrage. Since men in Tennessee were required to pay a poll tax, then the women should also pay the poll tax. They endorsed a call for a special session to enact a law for the assessment and collection of poll taxes from women voters in Tennessee, stating that it was fair and just for women to have the same obligations as men did in regard to suffrage.
3286. This six-page resolution from Carroll County outlines in their strong opposition to the ratification of the 19th Amendment as ""high handed and unwarranted action of the Tennessee legislature."" It lays out the constitutional arguments for their belief that the legislature, and especially Governor Albert H. Roberts, acted outside their legal powers. The resolution calls on all Tennesseans to ""save the state of Jackson, Polk and Johnson from the vile hands of those men . . . who have ridden our constitution, broken faith with the people who elected them, and flagrantly violated their oaths of office."" The writers applauded the legislators who fled Tennessee hoping to break quorum and prevent ratification for their ""heroic efforts to save the South and preserve to the States their right to control and regulate their own internal affairs."" The resolution was sent to Governor Roberts, Speaker of the House Seth Walker, Hon. C. W. Brooks, Hon. W. E. Weldon, the Nashville Banner and other newspapers.
3287. Writing on behalf of the Man Suffrage Association from New York, Walter Childs expressed his hope that Governor Roberts to stand against pressure of suffragists and cowardly politicians to sway him from his duty. According to Childs, representative government was at stake. In order to ""protect the basic rights of the people of many States, whose votes would be nullified by the passage of the 19th Amendment,"" he wanted the governor to stand firm against women's suffrage. He included a broadside entitled ""The People versus Woman Suffrage"" produced by the Man Suffrage Association that listed electoral defeats of women's suffrage efforts in various states as proof that ""suffrage is not coming by the will of the people.""
3288. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), wrote to Governor Roberts to assert that the organization will stand by and work with him in a straightforward manner on the ratification of the 19th Amendment. She expressed her desire for a meeting with Governor Roberts in Nashville. Her letter explained the nature of state auxiliaries within NAWSA, which operated democratically within each state and elected their own officers. NAWSA was strongly non-partisan, and made no effort to curtail the political work of its members. Catt outlined her views of the national Democratic Committee, and her hope that it would send a representative to talk with Tennessee legislators about ratification. ""The men who deals with politics, in the National sense, realize what the winning of the thirty-sixth state will do for the party, but this conviction does not necessarily reach the legislator who comes from some remote district in the state."" The leaders of the Democratic Party, including President Woodrow Wilson, knew the significance of winning the thirty-sixth state. Since Vermont's governor refused to call a session for ratification, the ""opportunity is therefore far more brilliant for Tennessee"" to become the pivotal thirty-sixth state to ratify the 19th Amendment.
3289. In this letter, S. C. Johnson informed the governor as a long time Democrat, he drew the line at supporting any candidate who proposed ""a law to degrade the womanhood of the South by ratifying the infamous Susan B. Anthony"" and at the same time ""remanding this country to the tender mercies of negro rule. . . "" He asserted that Mrs. [Carrie Chapman] Catt and her fanatics had more influence with the governor than the ""best thought of the South."" He told the governor that should retire from the gubernatorial race if he ratifies the amendment, for he would be defeated in the upcoming election. A typed copy of Governor Robert's response contains his explanation of his action to support the ratification, noting that the Democratic National Convention unanimously adopted a platform calling on Tennessee and other states to ratify the amendment.
3290. Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to invite Governor Roberts to the Suffrage Jubille Convention (called the Women Voter's Convention in a later letter). She listed the measures that she would like to see addressed in the call for an extra session of the legislature. These included a mother's pension, equal guardianship by both parents of the persons and property of children, a law removing restrictions from women holding office, and social hygiene laws. She asserted her confidence that the governor had considered whether additional legislation was needed before women voted in the upcoming primary elections, and thanked him for his aid in their work for child welfare. Governor Roberts' stated in his response on March 23 that it would be important to consider legal questions prior to the extra session, if it were called. ""The questions involved are too important and the rights of the people are too sacred for us to do anything in haste or imperfectly."" He added that it might be possible to consider some of the issues she raised in an extra session, but not all of them due to the limitations of time.
3291. Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to invite the governor to the opening session of the first convention of the Tennessee Women's Voters League. She worried that women may face injunctions when they vote in county or presidential elections, as granted by the Tennessee legislature in 1919, without a poll tax receipt. If they wait to address the issue until the ratification of the 19th Amendment, it could complicate the ability of women to vote in the August primaries. Milton included a flyer encouraging Tennessee women to participate in the Women Voters' Convention, where women would make an ""intensive study of citizenship"" and promote better legislation. Listed on the flyer are leaders of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, The Parent-Teachers Association, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the Tennessee Federation of Music Clubs, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Tennessee Press and Authors Club. In Governor Roberts' response, he thanked her for her letter and acknowledged the possible danger to the Democratic Party during the national election because of the failure to impose a poll tax on women. However, he did not want to call a special session for the issue, and then soon after need to call a second special session to ratify the 19th Amendment. He invited her to communicate further on the subject.
3292. William Roberts wrote, as an ""exiled Southerner"" living in New York City, to Governor Roberts to express his opposition to ""this proposed mischievous 19th Amendment."" He asked why a southern state should put its women ""not only on the same plane with their cooks and housemaids, but also with the half-naturalized women of New York's East Side."" He also noted that the female vote would not help the Democratic party.
3293. Catherine Talty Kenny, who chaired the ratification committee of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League and later the Tennessee League of Women Voters, wrote to assure Governor Roberts of her support in the upcoming election. She was ""by heritage and choice a Democrat"" and stated that it would be a privilege to support a governor whose support would make the enfranchisement of American women a reality. Of interest, the reverse side of the stationery contains a list of the Men's Ratification Committee.
3294. An ardent anti-suffrage man named George, wrote this three-page letter, and addressed Governor Roberts as ""brother."" He wrote that woman suffrage propaganda was the ""greatest menace to this Republic"" and that women in politics would be ""the beginning of the end . . . of this glorious Nation."" He also wrote of the strong ""sex impulse"" in women, and of women's ""feline instinct"" to obtain influence over men, to make them effeminate. He further charged that suffragettes compelled effeminate officials to ""march in that petticoat brigade and see suffragette 'Nymphs' dance bare legged on the treasury steps.""
3295. This telegram follows the earlier (2:31 a.m.) telegram from Sue Shelton White, chairman of the Tennessee branch of the National Woman's Party. In the first, she asked the governor to call a special session of the legislature. In this one, White offered hearty congratulations for calling special session of the legislature on August 9 that would allow for the enfranchisement of women in time for the presidential election. She noted that it ""ends the hard struggle of more than half a century and adds new glory to the unique history of the Volunteer State."" The second document is a copy of Governor Albert H. Roberts' to White, thanking her for her telegram, and confirming that he had called announced a special session of the legislature on August 9, and that the subject of ratification of the 19th Amendment would be included. See also image 42483
3296. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Women's Suffrage Association, rejoiced that Governor Roberts called a special session of the Tennessee legislature to consider ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave Tennessee ""the chance to render and incomparable service to the women of the whole country."" A copy of Gov. Roberts' reply to Catt affirmed that he had called a special session of the legislature to convene on August 9, and that the ratification of the 19th Amendment would be included.
3297. Former Chattanooga mayor William R. Crabtree challenged Roberts for the Democratic nomination for governor of Tennessee in 1920. He wrote that he considered the passage of the 19th Amendment to be more important than his success in challenging Roberts for the party nomination. If Roberts had to stop campaigning to deal with the special session, then Crabtree would also stop his speaking campaign. Crabtree stated that there was no political advancement worth blocking the political and legal emancipation of women.
3298. This act granted Tennessee women the right to vote in presidential and municipal elections. It also granted women the right to participate and vote in certain matters and elections and prescribed the qualifications and conditions under which women could exercise these rights of suffrage. In order to vote, women had to be at least 21 years of age, a citizen of the United States who had resided in Tennessee for at least a year, and within their present county for at least six months preceding an election. They were required to register to vote in the same manner as male voters. If male voters were required to provide evidence of the payment of a poll tax, then women voters would be required to furnish evidence of payment also. House Bill 717 was passed by the legislature on April 14, 1919 and signed by Seth Walker, Speaker of the House of Representatives and Andrew L. Todd, Speaker of the Senate on April 15, 1919. It was signed by Governor A. H. Roberts on April 17, 1919 after which the Ike B. Stevens, Tennessee Secretary of State, filed and assigned its chapter number. It was the first major victory for Tennessee suffragists.
3299. This joint resolution of the 61st General Assembly of the State of Tennessee to ratify the proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States to provide for women's suffrage was the source of heated debate in Tennessee in the August 1920. The document includes the text of House Joint Resolution 1 from the 66th U. S. Congress that proposed the constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. The State Senate ratified the amendment on August 13, 1920. The House of Representatives was evenly divided, and a fierce debate raged in newspapers, hotel lobbies and government offices, before the resolution was ratified by the House on August 18, 1920. Antisuffrage legislators tried to have the ratification repealed, but were unsuccessful. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby issued the proclamation that declared the ratification of the 19th Amendment, making it part of the United States Constitution, on August 26, 1920.
3300. This typed, filed with the original senate joint resolution, transcript chronicles discussion in the Tennessee Senate related to the ratification of the 19th Amendment to grant women the right to vote. The beginning of the discussion focuses on the legality of the special session, and whether the legislature can consider the amendment. The Standing Committee on Constitutional Amendments stated its opinion that the legislature had ""both a legal and moral right to ratify the proposed resolution."" They asserted that the U. S. Constitution granted the state legislature ""full power and jurisdiction"" to lawfully exercise this power, and provisions in the Constitution of Tennessee that might be used to deny the legislature this power were ""clearly null and void."" Anti-suffragists had claimed that the state constitution morally obligated legislators not to act upon the ratification resolution because it was being considered in a special session of the legislature. The Committee concluded their report by saying that the time for national women's suffrage was at hand, and they ""covet for Tennessee the signal honor of being the 36th and last state necessary to consummate this great reform."" The resolution to ratify the 19th Amendment passed on a roll call vote of 25 ayes, 4 noes, and 2 who were present but not voting. Senator McFarland explained why he did not vote on the resolution. Senator Finley Dorris, a support of women's suffrage, provided a lengthy explanation of why he believed that he was not violating his oath to the State of Tennessee by voting on the resolution.
3301. Writing as the president of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, Pearson encouraged Tennesseans to contact their legislators to state their belief that the legislators must uphold their oath to the state constitution. ""The fate of white civilization in the South may hang on a few votes either way, and YOUR action may be the deciding influence with YOUR representative . . . in this great battle for State Rights, Honor and the safety of Southern civilization."" A handwritten note on the back states that thousands of these letters were sent.
3302. This letter may have been a draft congratulatory message to the General Assembly to be sent after the defeat of ratification of the 19th Amendment. It calls the legislators ""champions of our beloved Tennessee's States Rights in our united fight for honor, integrity and constitutional protection."" Furthermore, ""you have been brave and fearless to strike the key note of an independent manhood that refuses to be effeminized"" and stood against powers that overstepped in trying to force them to accept the ignoble legislation. Listed as signers of the letter are Miss Josephine A. Pearson, Mrs. Geo. A. Washington, Mrs. Morgan Brown, Miss Josephine Farrell and Mrs. C. C. Gilbert.
3303. Sarah Wise wrote that she was trying to get an ""expression of sentiment"" about the Susan B. Anthony amendment from the various groups of Jewish women. She reported that Zella Armstrong planned to gauge the sentiment of additional women's clubs, and that if they could get a ""number worth while,"" they would write a petition to the governor. She also described a visit to Nashville in which she met with Rabbi Levinthal's wife and visited Centennial Park and the Parthenon. The envelope has an added note, likely by Josephine A. Pearson, stating ""The Jewish people and Rabbis stood solid with the cause vs Federal Suffrage.""
3304. This undated petition urged the women of Tennessee to sign this petition ""for the sake of your State and your sex"" against the issue of ""Votes-for-women."" According to the petition, the great majority of women opposed the ballot as an entrance into ""the turmoil of politics as unmixed evils"" that would ""degrade regard for our sex."" The petition cited many reasons for opposing woman suffrage. The work of motherhood was more important than politics. Women trusted their fathers, brothers and husbands to represent them at the ballot box, because their fathers and brothers loved them, they had chosen their husbands, and their sons were ""WHAT WE MADE THEM."" The petition asserted that the vote wasn't needed and would not be effective for women to achieve reforms. These women believed that women had a higher status and more protection in states where women did not have the right to vote, and that they had more ""power for good"" if they remained non-partisan and did not vote. They also claimed that the enactment of woman suffrage in Tennessee would increase taxation and add ""undesirable, corrupt and job hunting female politicians to the ranks of the male."" Finally, in support of their claim that the majority of women do not want the vote, they stated that suffragists opposed a referendum allowing women to vote on the suffrage issue because anti-suffragists had much higher numbers.
3305. Anti-suffrage leaders including Josephine A. Pearson, the president of the Tennessee Anti-Ratification League, gathered at Washington Hall in Robertson County. Mrs. George A. Washington, the vice-president of the Tennessee Anti-Ratification League hosted a ""distinguished gathering of women from various states . . . a number of Judges, Senators, etc. etc."" who had traveled from the Hermitage Hotel in Nashville. Washington Hall was destroyed by fire in 1965.
3306. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Josephine A. Pearson (1868-1944) was an educator from Monteagle who became president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and the Southern Woman�s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. She worked tirelessly with various women's groups, religious and political leaders throughout Tennessee in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the passage of women�s suffrage.
3307. This two-sided broadside, compiled by the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, presents race-based arguments against the ratification of the 19th Amendment. One side reprints resolutions of the National Association of Colored Women`s Clubs from their convention in Tuskegee, Alabama in June, 1920. The other side warns of the possible passage of three Force Bills designed to force states to enforce the 14th Amendment along with the 19th Amendment, should the latter pass. It states that these bills would reverse the trend of the previous thirty years, in which 14th and 15th Amendments had been allowed to ""rest lightly"" upon the South. It claims that Southern manhood will defend Anglo-Saxon civilization and reject the Force bills to avoid reopening the wounds of Reconstruction.
3308. This two-sided broadside contains the reprint, originally published in both the Nashville Banner and the Chattanooga Times, of an editorial and an article attacking Carrie Chapman Catt. One side contains an letter to Mrs. Catt from Mrs. James S. Pinkard, President of the Southern Women`s League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Pinkard asks Catt to explain what she meant by statements such as ""American women and men, white and black, should share equally in the privileges of democracy."" She states that Tennessee legislators would violate their oaths if they vote to ratify the suffrage amendment, and demands the truth in this matter of ""life and death"" for the South. The other side reprints an article from The Woman Patriot, an anti-suffrage publication, which asserts that Catt defamed the United States by decrying the treatment of women with claims such as the fact that women cannot vote while aliens, illiterates, drunkards, paupers, criminals and the feeble-minded can vote.
3309. This typed petition, stamped by the Tennessee Anti-Suffrage Association, enumerates the reasons for their opposition to women`s suffrage. Stating their resentment at having ""Votes for Women"" thrust upon them, they declare that the vote will draw women into the evil of politics and degrade their sex. They believe that women cannot effect any reform without the approval of men, and trust their fathers, brothers and sons to act in their best interest. They also claim that women are better protected in states without woman suffrage, and that giving women the franchise would increase taxation.
3310. Mrs. Brown, chairman of the executive committee of the Southern Women's League for the Rejection of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment, wrote this letter to the members of the Tennessee General Assembly. She stated that ""Seventeen men of honor on the Tennessee Senate and fifty in the House can save Southern civilization and local self government from destruction simply by keeping their solemn oaths to the people and Constitution of Tennessee."" In this three-page letter, she claims that suffragists are using underhanded tactics to gain their support because they ""dare not trust your judgment and your conscience."" She noted that Tennessee was one of only five states that had not acted on the 19th Amendment, and none of other four - North Carolina, Florida, Connecticut and Vermont - would ratify it. Brown claimed that opposition to women's suffrage was growing stronger every day and that suffragists were ""prosecuting the South . . . and asking you to serve as their packed jury."" She said that suffragists like Carrie Chapman Catt would not publicly debate the issue and resorted instead to flooding legislators with telegrams from politicians from outside Tennessee. Brown invited the legislators to visits the Anti-Ratification Exhibition at the Hermitage Hotel to see the documents that supported their opposition to the amendment.
3311. Written by a Nashville physician and suffrage opponent after the National American Woman Suffrage Association met in Nashville in 1914, this anti-suffrage pamphlet contains Lyon`s opinions of the suffragettes and his rationalization for limited suffrage and political involvement for women. Among his arguments against woman suffrage are assertions that many women will only vote as men tell them and that universal suffrage will ""enfranchies four or five million negresses.""
3312. This article from The Woman Citizen describes the celebrations in Washington, D.C. and New York City that followed the ratification of the 19th Amendment. It contains quotations from various suffragists who worked for ratification in Tennessee. It appears to be the conclusion of a series by Marjorie Shuler, but there is no byline to confirm her authorship.
3313. This booklet enumerates the items for which the Tennessee League of Women Voters asked the legislature to support in the interest of women and children. Among the issues are the civil status of women, including property rights of married women; education - including minimum 9 months school terms, minimun salaries and competency requirements for teachers, mandatory physical education, free kindergarten, and the establishment of a vocational school for black girls; women in industry - establishment of a minimum wage and a Department of Labor, the abolishment of the convict lease system, improvement in working hours and conditions for working women, and equal pay for equal work; and additional items related to child welfare, social hygiene, temperance and conservation. It includes a list of the state, district and departmental chairpersons. The organization was called the Tennessee League of Women Voters at the time of publication.
3314. This press release contains a 2-page statement by Carrie Chapman Catt about the machinations of the anti-suffragists to derail the ratification of the 19th Amendment by the Tennessee legislature. She refutes their constitutional arguments, calling their efforts ""merely filibustering tactics"" that were ""subversive of majority rule.""
3315. This four-page article details the struggle for the ratification of the 19th Amendment in Tennessee from the suffragist point of view. Actively involved in the process in Tennessee, Upton gives a dramatic account of the what happened in Tennessee. It is taken from the Headquarters News Bulletin published by the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association.
3316. A two page editorial in The Woman Citizen describing the constitutional situation in Tennessee which made calling a special session of the legislature to act on the ratification of the 19th Amendment difficult. After detailing the struggle, the article states that ""Tennessee seems to be quite all right, thank you."" It is followed by the announcement by Governor Albert H. Roberts that the special session will convene on August 9th.
3317. This article describes the final phase of the struggle for women`s suffrage, outlining the unsuccessful injunction against ratification in Tennessee, as well as the celebration in Washington following the official federal ratification. It names many of the women, such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Anne Dallas Dudley, who worked in Tennessee for the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The article contains two maps of the United States. The first is ""The Suffrage Map in Early August, 1920,"" showing states which allowed women full suffrage, limited suffrage such as for primaries, or presidential or municipal elections, or no suffrage at all. The second shows ""What Tennessee Did to the Suffrage Map,"" which was to grant full suffrage throughout the country.
3318. Kenny, one of the 6th Congressional District chairpersons of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to Carrie Chapman Catt about a meeting with Governor Albert H. Roberts about various suffrage issues. In 1919, Tennessee had passed legislation to allow women to vote in municipal and presidential elections, but it had not clarified whether or not women could vote in primary elections. At the time, Governor Roberts had been adamant that Tennessee law did not allow a special session for the ratification of the 19th Amendment. [He would later reconsider after substantial national pressure from Democratic leaders, including President Wilson.] Kenny believed that national Republicans had chosen Tennessee as their focus to ""break the Solid South,"" and saw women's suffrage as a chance to ""get the Negro women lined up."" She informed Catt that this situation could hurt the women's suffrage movement in the south. Kenny went on to describe how African American women had worked with the white women, though they had a separate organization. In a recent election, they had ""helped very decisively,"" noting that it was instead ""illiterate white women in the cotton factory district"" who were exploited. She praised the ""intelligent and dignified demeanor"" of the African American women, who - unlike their men - had stood against bribery and threats. Kenny wanted Catt to know ""how we handled the negro women"" and that they planned to ""send a negro woman into every district"" under the direction of the white organization. She wrote also of her pride in the victory for women's suffrage that Tennessee had won in earning presidential suffrage, accomplishing what their better organized and better funded sister states could not do.
3319. Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association during the fight for ratification of the 19th Amendment, spoke in 1983 at the age of 101 about the methods anti-suffragists used in 1920, including offering positions like railroad commissioner, bribery and sending false messages about illnesses at home, to keep legislators who favored suffrage from voting. She described the drunkeness and fighting at the Hermitage Hotel, noting that anti-suffrage legislators wore red roses on their coats.
3320. The 19th Amendment to the U. S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. When the Tennessee General Assembly passed the ratification resolution on August 18, 1920, it gave the amendment the 36th and final state necessary for ratification. Suffragists and anti-suffragists lobbied furiously to secure votes during that intense summer in Nashville. The ratification resolution passed easily in the Tennessee State Senate on August 13, but the House of Representatives was deadlocked. When young Harry T. Burn of Niota changed his vote to support ratification of the 19th Amendment, he broke a tie in the House of Representatives and made history. Abby Crawford Milton (1881-1991), a mother of three with a law degree, served as president of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage League during the battle to ratify the 19th Amendment in Tennessee. She gave speeches and helped establish suffrage organizations across the state, and spent August 1920 in Nashville working to convince legislators to vote for women's suffrage. Her husband, George Fort Milton, was the majority owner of the Chattanooga News, a newspaper that supported women's suffrage and was frequently critical of Governor Albert H. Roberts. Abby Crawford Milton became the first president of the League of Women Voters of Tennessee.
3321. Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association in 1920, spoke in 1983 at the age of 101 about young Representative Harry T. Burn's role in the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The suffragists lacked several votes in the House of Representatives. Speaker Seth Walker had originally supported suffrage, but had been ""persuaded by the opposition"" and became the leader of the opposition. Milton said that when Harry Burn changed his vote and broke the deadlock, Speaker Walker came down, put his arm around Harry, and tried to get him to change his vote. ""The reason that boy quit voting against us was because his mother had made him promise that if it came to his vote in the final showdown that he would favor the women, and he kept that promise to his mother, and Seth Walker, his friend, couldn't move him, couldn't shake him.""
3322. Abby Crawford Milton, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association during the fight for ratification of the 19th Amendment, spoke in 1983 at the age of 101 about the fierce battle that raged in Nashville in the very hot summer of 1920. Milton said that the mezzanine of the Hermitage Hotel had been bought up by the anti-suffragists, who served a lot of liquor at the Hermitage Hotel to legislators in an effort to take away votes. Milton also mentioned that the anti-suffragists showed off the ""Woman's Bible,"" calling it ""Mrs. Catt's Bible,"" noting that twentiy-six preachers and churches in Nashville turned against women's suffrage after seeing the book. Mrs. Catt denied that she was associated with the ""Bible"" many times, and Milton told her to deny it again. Milton noted that it showed you how hard the anti-suffragists fought that summer.
3323. This anti-suffrage article from the The Lookout, a ""Journal of Southern Society"" published in Chattanooga, contains a vivid description of events in Nashville during the special session of the legislature that ratified the 19th Amendment. It describes the pandemonium in the capital, and chronicles activities of both politicians and the socially prominent women involved in the struggle. ""The Battle of the Roses waged day and night . . . on the Battle Ground, which was practically all over the Hermitage Hotel and the State Capital."" It highlights the controversy surrounding the ""Woman's Bible,"" the questionable antics of suffragists to win votes, and the pressures applied to young Harry T. Burn to change his vote in favor of suffrage, quoting an anti-suffragist who called him ""the Benedict Arnold of the South."" Another anti-suffragist reportedly said, ""Tennessee is being made a Catt's paw,"" a reference to national suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt. Since the serious issues had been covered by newspaper agencies from all over the country, this article added descriptions of humorous incidents, such as an anti-suffrage legislator who cut off his tie to escape an overly ardent young suffragist. The last page contains information about the travels of prominent citizens, and indicates that suffragist Abby Crawford Milton and her family had returned from Nashville. It also mentions that Sarah (Mrs. Harry) Wise, author of this letter [see also image 42515] to Josephine A. Pearson, had returned from Nashville ""where she joined Anti-Ratification forces.""
3324. Josephine A. Pearson, the president of the Tennessee State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, wrote to Governor Roberts after the passage of the equal suffrage bill in Tennessee which granted women the right to vote in municipal and federal elections. She pleaded with the governor to repeal the legislation, and said that she had written to some state senators who ""represent something of the chivalry of the old South"" in the hope that ""Southern manhood . . . has not yet become Effeminized!"" She stated that she had refused to join the political fight as the suffragists had, leaving that to the men of the state. Pearson stated that she would ""rather go down in glorious defeat rather than feel that I led the women of my native state to soil the escutcheon of Southern womanhood in the 'mire of politics'!""
3325. Kate (Mrs. Leslie) Warner, president of the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, wrote to Governor Albert H. Roberts to decry the picketing tactics used by more militant suffragists. She enclosed two articles. In the first, Warner pointed out that the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association, headed nationally by Carrie Chapman Catt, was different than the ""Militant or Woman's Party"" of which Alice Paul was the president. She did not want her organization to be held responsible for the actions fo the more militant group. The second article reported that Joy Young, a representative of the National Woman's Party, planned to remain in Tennessee, despite the ""repudiation"" by Mrs. Warner. The article contains a lengthy quote from Sue Shelton White of Jackson, Tennessee, explaining her decision to decline an invitation from Tennessee Woman Suffrage Association and to work with the National Woman's Party instead. White stated that she maintained her good standing with the national association and Carrie Chapman Catt, and hope that Warner and Nashville suffragists would ""turn their guns on the opponents of suffrage, rather than upon other suffragists."" Governor Roberts replied to tell her that he appreciated her sensible attitude. He stated that the picketing suffragists ""by their folly"" were delaying the coming of women's suffrage more than any other influences.

3361. John Overton was the collector in Tennessee of the first Federal excise tax, the so-called Whiskey Tax. The entries from his ledgers list distillers in Tennessee by county. The record details those who distilled spirits, the number of pots or stills, their annual production of distilled spirits in gallons, and the amount of tax owed. This volume, 1796-1801, includes entries for Andrew Jackson and his whisky operations at Hunter's Hill outside Nashville, his residence before purchasing the Hermitage property.
3362. This tax volume is a product of the earliest federal tax in the United States, an excise on all distilled spirits produced in the United States. This tax was the revenue-generating part of Washington's Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton's grand plan to repay the bonded debt owed from the Revolutionary War and to establish the fiscal standing of the national government. Because it was done on the backs of farmers, many of whom distilled their corn into value-added whisky, the excise was widely unpopular in rural areas; it sparked the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania and discontent generally. Distilling was a staple rural industry in frontier America, and particularly in this largely Scot-Irish state, where many Tennesseans distilled whiskey to sell, imbibe, and as a dietary and medicinal supplement.
